<h2>THE CENTENARY OF THE
CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY.</h2>

<p class="center">By the Rev. A. R. Buckland, M.A., Morning Preacher at the Foundling Hospital.</p>


<p>At "The Castle
and Falcon,"
in Aldersgate
Street, on
April 12th,
1799, there
met, in all
the solemnity
of a
public
gathering,
sixteen
clergymen
and nine
laymen.</p>

<p>They founded there and then the
Church Missionary Society for Africa and
the East. That Society keeps its Centenary
this month; no longer an inconspicuous
organisation expressing the hopes of
a godly few, but a great Society which
has girdled the earth with its missions.
When, in November, 1898, its Estimates
Committee surveyed its position, they
found that its roll included the names
of 802 European missionaries, of whom 295
were ladies, whilst, of the 802, no fewer
than eighty-four were serving altogether
or in part at their own expense. Some
of them represented the missionary
enthusiasm of Australia and Canada;
a fair proportion were duly qualified
medical workers, men and women.</p>

</div>

<p>With the exception of South America,
there is no considerable quarter of the
globe in which they are not represented.
They may be found ministering
to Esquimaux within the Arctic Circle,
and to the Indians of the vast expanses
of Canada; they are shepherding the
Maoris of New Zealand; in India their
stations may be discovered alike amongst
the wild tribes of the northern frontier,
the strange aboriginals found here and
there in the continent, and the milder
races of the south; in Africa the
Society begins in Egypt, but goes no
farther south than Uganda, though it
is both on the east coast and the
west; it is strongly represented along
the coasts of China, as well as in the
inland province of Sze-Chuen; it works
both amidst the Japanese themselves
and that strange people the hairy
Ainu; it is domiciled in Ceylon and
Mauritius; it has not forgotten Persia.
From Madagascar it has retired, and it
has shown a wise indisposition to enter
upon new fields whilst the old are
still insufficiently manned. It has ever
been known for the strictness with
which it observes the comity of missions;
and it may fairly be said that
the zeal with which its friends have
worked in behalf of foreign missions
has reacted on all the missionary
agencies which have their origins in
Great Britain, as well as upon some
which express the zeal of America and
the Colonies.</p>

<p>The Church Missionary Society was
really one of the fruits of the Evangelical
Revival, though when the Society
was born that movement was no longer
young. Its first leaders had passed
to their rest; it was their successors
amongst whom the Church Missionary
Society took its origin. They were, as
history judges them, no mean persons,
though in their own day they fell, for
their religious zeal, under the condemnation
of polite society, whether ecclesiastical
or social.</p>

</div>

<p>That meeting in Aldersgate Street did
not include some of those to whom the
foundation of the Church Missionary
Society must directly be referred; but, if
we look at the circle they represented, we
shall find that it was one of rare distinction
in the religious history of the country.
It included William Wilberforce, Zachary
Macaulay, Charles Grant, James Stephen,
and Henry Thornton on the lay
side; Charles Simeon, John Newton,
Thomas Scott, Richard Cecil, and
William Goode amongst the clergy.
The impulse which moved them was
moving others, for the Baptist Missionary
Society had been founded by Carey
in 1793, and the London Missionary
Society in 1795. The Religious Tract
Society also began its existence in this
year 1799, and the Bible Society was
founded in 1804. It was a fruitful
epoch. Yet it has to be remembered
that it began under ecclesiastical discouragement,
and amidst such popular
contempt of missions to the heathen as
was reflected in Sydney Smith's essay.</p>

<p>I do not propose to trace in detail the
history of the Church Missionary Society:
within the space of a magazine article
such an attempt could do little more than
produce a list of names and dates. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
may be more useful, as well as more interesting,
to look at some of the Society's
great workers at home, at some of its
heroes in the mission-field, and at some
of the romances which diversify its
history.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the men who helped to found the
Church Missionary Society the first place
must be given to Charles Simeon. He
was not at "The Castle and Falcon"
meeting, but it was he who, at the
gathering of the Eclectic Society in
March of the same year, when missionary
plans were again under discussion, urged
immediate action. "There is not a
moment to be lost," he said; "we have
been dreaming these four years, while
all Europe is awake." The precise old
bachelor, fellow of his college at Cambridge,
and incumbent of Holy Trinity
Church in that town, was not a person
easily daunted by obstacles. As an Evangelical
he had had to face the most
strenuous opposition in his own parish.
But he had been deeply stirred by plans
and hopes for missionary work in India;
he was the friend and mentor of Henry
Martyn. He was able in time to wield at
Cambridge an influence which the late
Bishop Christopher Wordsworth compared
to that of Newman at Oxford.
Later generations somehow came to
think of him as something other than a
Churchman; but they were quite wrong.
A careful scrutiny of Simeon's works, letters,
and diaries will show that he was
consistently loyal to his Church and her
formularies. Of his influence upon foreign
missions it is difficult to speak in exaggeration;
but one or two illustrations
may serve to show its extent. Henry
Martyn was the first Englishman who
offered to go out under the Church
Missionary Society. But Simeon was
especially anxious about India, and so
Martyn went there as "Chaplain." His
brief work in Persia, the example of
his singularly beautiful character, and
the swift end of so promising a career,
still influence the minds of young and
old. And the influence of Martyn, is,
in a sense, the influence of Simeon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Less popularly known than Henry
Martyn, but in some respects of
wider power, were the others of
the famous "Five Chaplains" who
went out to India, the fruits of
Simeon's zeal for that land. These
men left an indelible mark upon
the English in India during their
time, and did much to prepare the
way of the missionary. Thus
Claudius Buchanan helped more
than any other man to create the
public opinion which opened India
to missionaries, and led to the consecration
of the first bishop for all
India, the Bishop of Calcutta.
Thomas Thomason was the father
of James Thomason, who, as Lieutenant-Governor
of the North-West
Provinces, ruled (and taught others
to rule) in the fear of God, and with
the warmest sympathy for missionary
enterprise. Through him, when
the Punjab was annexed in 1849, it
felt the influence which had flowed
from the rooms of Charles Simeon
at Cambridge.</p>

<p>The name of Edward Bickersteth
seems a natural succession to that
of Simeon. The influence of both
is still unexhausted. When the
Church Missionary Society kept its
second Jubilee in November, 1898,
the sermon was preached by Bishop
E. H. Bickersteth, the son of Edward
Bickersteth. And the influence had
been wider than the limits of any
one Society, for Bishop Edward
Bickersteth, of Japan, who died in
1897, represented another generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
in this line of truly apostolic succession.</p>

<p>Edward Bickersteth had been a solicitor
in prosperous circumstances when zeal
for missions led him to take holy orders,
and join the Church Missionary Society
as Assistant Secretary in 1816. Almost
at once he was sent to examine the
Society's work at Sierra Leone. There
he admitted the Society's first African
converts to the Holy Communion. In
1824 he succeeded Josiah Pratt in the
Secretaryship of the Society. He was
never an autocrat in the sense that Henry
Venn was; but his work for the Society
in the country was enormous. It has
ceased to be the kind of work which is
mainly done by the Honorary Secretary
of the Society, but at that period it was
work which was of inestimable value. It
was the more important because public
opinion at home still presented a front
of mingled contempt and indifference to
missions, whilst abroad the outlook was
far from hopeful.</p>

<p>A greater figure than that of Edward
Bickersteth in the annals of the Church
Missionary Society is that of Henry Venn.
Here, too, the name appears in more than
one generation. The first Henry Venn
belongs, with Wesley, Whitfield, Romaine
and others, to the beginnings of the Evangelical
Revival. Then comes John Venn,
who took the chair at "The Castle and
Falcon" meeting. Then, in 1834, Henry
Venn the younger, the son of John
Venn and grandson of the first Henry
Venn, began regularly to attend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
Society's Committee. He was Hon. Secretary
in 1841, and held office for thirty-one
years. He is the standard by which,
doubtless, for generations to come, Hon.
Secretaries of the Church Missionary
Society will be compared. He was a
strong man in every sense; a statesman
and an autocrat. But, like some other
autocrats, he clung to his work too long.
He resigned only a few months before
his death, and left the Society in a condition
of discouragement, from the failure
both of candidates for the mission field
and of means for carrying on the work.
Under his successor, Henry Wright (who
was drowned in Coniston Lake in 1880),
the Society began almost at once to
enter upon new life and activity. Here
again the hereditary influence, so manifest
in the work of the Church Missionary
Society, is evident, for four of his children
went to the mission field. His successor,
Frederic Wigram, was one of the most
munificent benefactors the Society ever
had. He died, after resigning office, worn
out by its responsibility and toil. He,
too, has sent children to the mission-field.
In his successor, the Rev. H. E. Fox, the
hereditary impulse is manifest again.
Mr. Fox's father was one of the founders
of the Society's Telugu mission, and one
of the most devoted of its workers in
the foreign field.</p>

<p>And now let us glance for a moment
at some of the Society's agents abroad.
The task of selection is difficult. There
are names on the list that all men
who care for missions have heard of.
Samuel Marsden, Samuel Crowther,
Valpy French, Pfander, John Horden,
James Hannington, Alexander Mackay&mdash;these,
to name but a few, and many
others, are familiar far outside the
limits of the Society's own friends. But
there are more, less widely known,
whose work deserves not a whit less
to be had in remembrance.</p>

</div>

<p>Amongst these was William Johnson,
one of the first missionaries to Sierra
Leone. He went out in 1816, and began
an extraordinary work amongst the
slaves released by British cruisers and
landed at Sierra Leone. He died on the
voyage home to England at the early
age of thirty-four. Those were the days
in which to face work in Sierra Leone
meant facing a peril so imminent that
each volunteer needed the courage of
those who go upon a forlorn hope.</p>

<p>There was William Williams, first a surgeon
and then, after graduating at Oxford,
ordained for work in the Colonies. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
went to New Zealand in 1825, when
its people were a race of cannibals, not
one of whom professed Christianity. He
lived to see the whole country more
or less fully evangelised. His wife died
as recently as 1896, and his son, baptised
in 1829 with the children of one of the
most savage of the Maori chiefs, became
Bishop of Waiapu in the land the
father did so much to open up. William
Williams had a brother, Henry Williams,
who preceded him in the field. So great
was the influence he won that, on the
news of his death reaching two Maori
camps, in which rival tribes were preparing
to meet in battle, they at once
proclaimed a truce, attended his funeral,
and settled their differences in peace.</p>

<p>There was Ludwig Krapf, whose name,
with that of John Rebmaun, should
ever be joined with the origins of our
growing empire in Eastern Equatorial
Africa. He began his missionary work
in Abyssinia, had to leave as the result
of French intrigues, sailed down the
East African coast in an Arab boat, and
in 1844 settled at Mombasa. From the
knowledge of the interior gained by
Krapf and his companion, came the
chain of African discovery which issued,
as long afterwards as 1875, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
publication, through Mr. H. M. Stanley,
of Mtesa's appeal for missionaries for
Uganda. How little could Krapf ever
have dreamed of the vast results,
political as well as spiritual, that would
flow from that early disappointment, his
expulsion from Abyssinia!</p>

<p>There was David Hinderer, who, upon
the other side of Africa, did so striking
a work in the Yoruba country. The
prosperity of his evangelistic labours,
the virtual imprisonment in which he
and his wife&mdash;half-starved and in deadly
peril&mdash;were for five years in the town
of Ibadan, and the ultimate discovery
that their work stood the severe tests
of isolation and persecution, go to make
up one of the most interesting chapters
in the history of African missions.</p>

<p>There was George Maxwell Gordon, the
pilgrim-missionary of the Indian frontier,
a pioneer who saw little direct fruit of
his labours, yet left missions where none
had been. Acting as chaplain to the
British forces shut up in Kandahar, he
was killed, when seeking to succour the
wounded, in August, 1880.</p>

<p>But this is a list that might be almost
indefinitely extended, and still would
seem invidious. Let us come to some
striking pages in the Society's history;
again, of necessity, passing by many of
the most impressive as well as some of
the most familiar.</p>

<p>The city of Peshawur, upon the Afghan
frontier, has long been a centre of missionary
work. The fanaticism of the people
when it was first occupied by British
troops seemed to make missionary enterprise
impossible. One Commissioner&mdash;he
afterwards fell by the hand of an assassin&mdash;refused
permission for missionaries to
come, on the ground that they would
excite the fanaticism of the people
to a dangerous pitch. The arrival of
Herbert Edwardes changed the situation.
A meeting of English people, military and
civil, was called in Peshawur itself; a
sum of £3,000 was raised, a memorial sent
to the Church Missionary Society, and, in
response, missionaries provided. Here is an
example of what is so often forgotten by
critics of Indian missions, that they in a
large measure owe their origin and support
to men actually or formerly engaged in
the administration of India. The Church
Missionary Society has been peculiarly
happy in the number of men of high distinction
in the Army and the Civil Service
who have served on its Committee. Now
from the Punjab men are pushing still
farther afield; Quetta has long been
occupied, and the medical missionary has
found a welcome from the Afridis themselves.</p>

<p>Let us take another mission founded in
answer to an appeal from without, and
that an appeal from a layman. People
who recall the missionary meetings of a
generation ago will remember that no more
thrilling story was told at them than the
history of William Duncan's early work
amongst the Tsimshean Indians of the
North Pacific coast. It was a marvellous
example of courage, tact, and patience,
rewarded by the conversion of savages of
a singularly unapproachable type. It was
a naval officer, Captain Prevost, who
suggested that mission to the Society,
carried Mr. Duncan thither, and landed
him at Fort Simpson in 1857. In ten
years' time he had baptised nearly three
hundred adult converts. In 1862 the
Christian community was moved to
Metlakahtla, where the spectacle of a
cannibal and violent people living in peace
and industry was long deemed one of
the marvels of missionary enterprise.</p>

<p>I pass by such striking histories as
those of Uganda, of the attempt of J.
A. Robinson and Graham Wilmot Brooke
to reach the Soudan from the Niger, and
of the massacre of English women at
Hwa-Sang in Fuh-kien, to recall romances
of another kind. What could be more
moving than the careers of some of the
Society's converts? Is there any more
striking history of its kind than that of
the Rev. Dr. Imad-ud-din, a learned
Mohammedan, who had sought the peace
of God by every available means, and
at last found it in Christ? Or what would
they who distrust converts say to the
career of that once notorious Border
bandit, Dilawar Khan, baptised in 1858,
who served as an officer in the Guides,
and died in Chitral whilst in the service
of the British Government?</p>

<p>But it is time to leave these things and
to speak of some aspects of the Society's
work which concern all missionary enterprise.</p>

</div>

<p>Twice in its career the Church Missionary
Society has definitely committed itself to
a policy of faith as it has committed
itself to sending out all who offer and
are found qualified. It is a policy which,
judged by the most secular standard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
must be accounted a success. The growth
of its staff in recent years, under this
system, has been most striking. The
Society has had its periods of stagnation
and disappointment; at times its directors
have felt driven to retrenchment. Thus
in 1859 the number of European missionaries
on its roll was 226; ten years later
it was only 228. But, whereas in 1889
the number was 360, in 1898 it had risen
to 802. During the first ten years the
Society sent out five agents; in the ten
years ending with its Jubilee the number
was 119; in the nine years ending 1898
it reached 719. The income of 1848 was
£92,823; the income of 1898 was £331,598.
Its latest statistics show that there are
about 240,000 natives associated with its
missions, and of late it would seem that
its clergy baptise on an average about
twenty adult converts every day.</p>

<p>In this month of April all round the
world&mdash;from North-West Canada to New
Zealand, from Palestine to Japan, from
Central Africa to the Indian frontier&mdash;men
will be keeping the centenary of
that meeting at "The Castle and Falcon,"
in Aldersgate Street. For a hundred
years of work, considered in relation
to the power and the wealth and the
responsibilities of our nation, there may
be little to show; but, for such as there
is, men of many races, and once of many
creeds, will, with one accord, give thanks
to God.</p>

<h2>THE MASTERFUL YOUNG MAN</h2>

<h3><em>A COMPLETE STORY.</em></h3>

<p class="center">By Margaret Westrup, Author of "They Furriners," Etc.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus012a.jpg" alt="A" width="100" height="166" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">He stopped in the
shade of the
high old wall
and listened.</p>
</div>

<p>A smile shone
in his blue eyes
as the sweet,
childish voice
sounded clear
and high in the
still, scented
air.</p>

<p>"What now,
Jeannette, shall the
mistress of Ancelles
fall in love like an
ordinary mortal, then?"</p>

<p>There was mischief in the
pretty voice, but there was
pride, too.</p>

<p>"But yes, mamzelle! Love
comes to all&mdash;high and low&mdash;and
spares no one its pangs."</p>

<p>"Pangs? Ah, bah! it shall have no
pangs for me!"</p>

<p>"Ah, mamzelle! do not be rash."</p>

<p>"How will it take me, Jeannette?
Tell me, that I may be prepared. Will
it come like a fiery dart to my bosom,
bringing a light to my eyes, and a
colour of roses to my cheeks? Or will
it take me sadly, rendering my cheek
pale and my spirits low? Tell me,
Jeannette."</p>

<p>"Not the last way, mamzelle"&mdash;the
voice was slow now&mdash;"for you are too
proud."</p>

<p>"You are right, Jeannette, I am too
proud! 'Tis not I who must be pale and
afraid. 'Tis the other. Love must come
to me humble and suing&mdash;to be glad or
sorry at my will. Is it not so, Jeannette?"</p>

<p>"How should I know, mamzelle?"&mdash;sadly&mdash;"I
dread its coming at all."</p>

<p>"Bah! what matters it? And why
should it come? I, for one, do not
want&mdash;&mdash; Ah! do not scream so, Jeannette&mdash;it
is a man&mdash;he is hurt."</p>

<p>The man scrambled to his feet, and tried
to bow, but his face was ghastly.</p>

<p>"I beg your&mdash;pardon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are hurt, monsieur. Do not try
to apologise. Jeannette, help him to the
house. Follow me."</p>

<p>The man leant on Jeannette's stout
shoulder, and followed the stately little
figure through the sunny, twisting paths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
sweet and rich with their wealth of roses,
up to the old château with its narrow
windows gleaming in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Here, Jeannette," said the little mistress
of the roses and the château.
"Monsieur, you will rest on the sofa."</p>

<p>He obeyed the wave of the small white
hand and lay down.</p>

<p>"Jeannette, send for Dr. Raunay."</p>

<p>Jeannette departed.</p>

<p>The man opened his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must not speak," eyeing him with
grave, dark eyes. "You will keep quiet
till the doctor comes."</p>

<p>He submitted.</p>

<p>Jeannette returned immediately.</p>

<p>"Are you thirsty?" asked his little
hostess gently.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;thank you."</p>

<p>"You want for nothing?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>She sat down and waited.</p>

<p>Then later&mdash;"Jeannette, lower the
blinds. Make no noise."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the man.</p>

<p>"Do not speak!"&mdash;frowning.</p>

<p>He smiled a little.</p>

<p>"Mamzelle, suppose he dies?"</p>

<p>"Jeannette, how <em>dare</em> you?"</p>

<p>"But his face is white; and"&mdash;her suspicions
bursting out&mdash;"how came he to
fall into mamzelle's garden?"</p>

<p>"Jeannette, leave the room!"</p>

<p>"That I will not! No, I will not!
Jeannette knows what is owing to her
mistress, and to leave&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well"&mdash;quickly&mdash;"but do not
dare to utter another word."</p>

<p>Jeannette mumbled rebelliously, but
retired to a corner vanquished.</p>

<p>The man opened his eyes as a soft wave
of air was wafted across his face.</p>

<p>A pair of soft, dark eyes looked down
pityingly into his.</p>

<p>He shut his own with a murmured word
of thanks, and let her fan him. Jeannette
came ponderously across the room.</p>

<p>"Mamzelle, it is not fitting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did I not forbid you to speak?" said
the haughty young voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, but Jeannette knows what is due
to mamzelle, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle also knows."</p>

<p>Something in the tone stopped the old
servant's words, and once more she retired
vanquished.</p>

<p>The man smiled to himself.</p>

<p>Dr. Raunay came and pronounced a bad
sprain of the left arm to be the only
injury the man had received.</p>

<p>The doctor's sharp, black eyes were
full of questions, but Mademoiselle Stéphanie
met his gaze calmly, indifferently,
and he dared not put one question into
words.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, of course, will be our guest,"
she said when the doctor had taken his
departure.</p>

<p>The man reddened slowly under his
tan.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;really&mdash;&mdash;" He raised himself on
his right elbow.</p>

<p>Jeannette eyed him with sharp suspicion.</p>

<p>"Of course, you will stay," said mademoiselle,
with her little imperious air.</p>

<p>"But I am quite well enough to go to
an inn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is not one within five miles, and
that&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;" A little expressive wave
of the small hands and a whimsical smile
finished her sentence.</p>

<p>"I do not like to trespass&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not trespassing," with pretty
warmth; "indeed, monsieur, you must
accept of our hospitality."</p>

<p>"Then thank you very much."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;your luggage? Is it with
friends? They will be anxious&mdash;we will
send&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was too courteous to ask with whom
he was staying. Yet she wondered much,
for, beyond poor cottages, there were no
dwellings within many miles of Ancelles.</p>

<p>"I am alone," he answered; "I have
walked from B&mdash;&mdash; to-day."</p>

<p>Jeannette snorted. She plainly did not
believe him. B&mdash;&mdash; was thirty and more
miles distant. The suspicion in her stare
grew deeper.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Stéphanie.</p>

<p>"My luggage&mdash;&mdash;" He hesitated; yet
what could he do without it? "It is
only a small bag&mdash;it is&mdash;er&mdash;outside your
garden wall," he finished desperately.</p>

<p>"Jeannette, please see that it is fetched
at once."</p>

<p>No faintest spark of surprise appeared
in his hostess's small face. She seemed
quite used to having strangers tumble
over her wall into her garden, quite used
to luggage being left outside the wall.</p>

<p>The man was distinctly amused, but
he was touched too.</p>

<p>An old manservant, with a faint, indescribable
old-world air, that fitted in
with the château and the garden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
the roses somehow, brought food to the
stranger, and, after he had eaten, showed
him to his room.</p>

<p>The stranger looked round him with
interest.</p>

<p>It was a large apartment, large and
bare and old&mdash;but everything at Ancelles
was old.</p>

<p>But the curtains to the bed, faded now,
had once been rich and handsome. The
tapestry across the door of a smaller
room leading from the other, was still
beautiful though worn with age.</p>

<p>Hugh Michelhurst shivered a little as
he stood there, in the dim, dark, old-world
chamber. There was something
pathetic in the tale it told of bygone
splendour, something sad and forlorn.</p>

<p>Then his eye fell on a bowl of vivid
red roses standing on his dressing-table,
and he smiled.</p>

<p>They at least were not old. Their
splendour was undimmed. There was
nothing faded in their fresh, glowing
beauty; and who had put them there?</p>

<p>He went closer; he bent over them and
drank in their sweet scent. And as he
did it the old, sunny garden rose before
him again. The little twisting paths, the
roses so thick and luxuriant that they
trespassed forward from their beds; the
old broken fountain, with the water
nymph bending eternally in graceful
readiness to dive, and amongst them&mdash;the
roses, the sunshine, the queer paths,
and the old fountain&mdash;the little mistress
of them all, slim, childish, with soft dark
eyes, with pretty lips made for laughter,
with the sun caught in the waves of her
brown hair. His hands wandered gently
over the roses as he stood and thought
what a gracious little hostess she was!
How sweetly she had welcomed him,
asking no questions!</p>

<p>A wave of colour surged over his white
face.</p>

<p>But he smiled as he sank down on to
a chair.</p>

<p>His entry into the sweet, old-world
garden had been supremely ridiculous.
Moreover, he was terribly ashamed of
himself as well as rueful.</p>

<p>But his sense of humour was strong
enough to save either feeling from overpowering
him. His arm began to pain
him badly again. He shut his lips tightly
and sat still.</p>

<p>Outside he heard a gay young voice.
"It is a pity, Jeannette, that the sun
does not shine into his room now. See
how glorious is its setting to-night."</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>Hugh Michelhurst guessed how the
pause was filled by his little hostess's
mocking answer:</p>

<p>"Why, Jeannette, how cross you are!
And, anyway, in the morning the sun
will wake him."</p>

<p>"It may rain, mamzelle."</p>

<p>"Rain?" with a little burst of prettiest
laughter. "Why, where are your eyes,
Jeannette? Rain? With that sky&mdash;that
sunset? All, no! Even <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma tante</i>
would not say that, and she always
predicts rain, you know."</p>

<p>"It is her rheumatism, mamzelle; she
feels it in her bones."</p>

<p>"Yes," carelessly. "Jeannette, he will
need assistance&mdash;how careless I am! It
is that I am so unused to entertaining a
guest, and yet once Ancelles was noted
for its hospitality&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The pretty voice died away into the
distance, and a few minutes later there
was a discreet tap at the stranger's door,
and the faded old manservant appeared,
and, with an air, offered monsieur his
humble services.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two mornings had Stéphanie's prophecy
been fulfilled. Two mornings the
sun had wakened her guest, and now
he was wondering if he dared stay and
let it wake him a third.</p>

<p>"Madame ma tante" had put in an
appearance once. She had welcomed
the stranger with a stiff yet courteous
stateliness that was as old-worldly as
the garden and the château and everything
pertaining thereto.</p>

<p>She was a confirmed invalid, and, till
she sallied forth to welcome her niece's
guest (Ancelles belonged to Stéphanie),
had not left her room for nearly two
years.</p>

<p>Hugh Michelhurst was duly presented,
and made a favourable impression on
"Madame ma tante." In half an hour
the impression had faded. In an hour
it was gone. "Madame ma tante" had
forgotten his existence.</p>

<p>He was sitting now on the old, worn
steps leading to the second terrace.
His right arm rested on the step
above, close by his hostess's dainty little
feet.</p>

<p>The air was sunny and warm, and
sweet with the scent of roses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>He wondered dreamily what had become
of the world&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus015.jpg" width="250" height="403" alt="smiled" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">She smiled softly at his words.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A little breeze came and scattered
the rose leaves in her lap&mdash;the soft,
fragrant heap that she had gathered
for <em>pot-pourri</em>&mdash;and roused the man.</p>

<p>He stooped to gather them up, but
she stayed him.</p>

<p>"There are plenty more," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "what a lovely old
garden it is!"</p>

<p>He watched the pink deepen in her
cheek, and the little dimples come
and go as she smiled softly at his
words.</p>

<p>Then he sighed.</p>

<p>"My arm is better," he said. "I"&mdash;doubtfully&mdash;"must
go to-day."</p>

<p>"Must you? Will you not stay a
little longer? It"&mdash;wistfully&mdash;"is nice
to have a guest."</p>

<p>He looked up at her with
his blue eyes full of love.</p>

<p>"It is good of you to say
so," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ancelles cannot offer
much," she said, with a little
stately air, "but it offers you
a true welcome, monsieur,
and one that will never fail
you so long as you will stay
with us."</p>

<p>"I have never," he said
slowly, "had such a true
welcome before."</p>

<p>His eyes made her restless.</p>

<p>She crushed the rose leaves
in her hand, and scattered
them abroad.</p>

<p>He picked them up and
kept them.</p>

<p>"Do you never wonder,"
he said, "how I came to fall
into your garden?"</p>

<p>"We are only glad that
monsieur so fell, except for
the sprained arm," answered
the little mistress of Ancelles.</p>

<p>"I heard your voice," he
said, looking up into her
face. "I stood and listened,
and then&mdash;I wanted to see
the owner of the voice, and
I climbed to the top of the
wall and then&mdash;I fell."</p>

<p>"I thought only schoolboys
behaved so," she said, but
her pretty lips parted and
her eyes smiled, in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>"If I had been a schoolboy
I should not have fallen."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because a schoolboy does not lose
his head as I did, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"And your footing, monsieur."</p>

<p>"The one was an outcome of the
other."</p>

<p>She looked away across the sweet,
smiling sunshine.</p>

<p>"Monsieur"&mdash;suddenly bending her gaze
upon his face&mdash;"how came you to lose
your head?"</p>

<p>He glanced at her in swift surprise.
He was no chicken-heart, yet something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
in the proud little face made him hesitate.</p>

<p>But he was proud, too.</p>

<p>"Because directly my eyes fell upon
you I loved you," he said steadily.</p>

<p>Stéphanie started to her feet.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you outrage my hospitality,"
she said haughtily.</p>

<p>He got up and faced her.</p>

<p>"Never!" he cried. "I did not mean
to say it&mdash;yet, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You insult me, monsieur!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, mademoiselle"&mdash;his tone
was cool as hers now&mdash;"but the offer
of a man's heart and home can never
be an insult!"</p>

<p>"An honour, perhaps?" mockingly.</p>

<p>"It is at least his best, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"And seemly within a two-days' acquaintanceship,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>Her pride, the haughty little smile
curling her pretty lip, maddened him.</p>

<p>He bent towards her.</p>

<p>"Seemly or unseemly," he said in low,
tense tones, "you shall love me!"</p>

<p>Her dark eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"I shall not, monsieur!" she cried,
and shut her small teeth closely.</p>

<p>With a haughty inclination of her
pretty head, she left him&mdash;left him
amongst the roses, in the sunshine, but
cold at heart at what he had done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He wooed her persistently. He was
persistent by nature, and all his life
he had never wanted anything as he
wanted her. He bore the discomforts of
the little inn without a murmur, and
every day the roses on the little twisting
paths found him among them.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was proud and cold;
mademoiselle was proud and mocking,
proud and wilful, proud and laughing,
proud and non-comprehending&mdash;every
mood in the world, one after another,
was mademoiselle, but proud always&mdash;proud
with them all. And at last he lost
heart.</p>

<p>So there came a day when the scent
of the roses sickened him, when the
twisting paths maddened him, and he
stood before the little mistress of them
all, white, stern, beaten.</p>

<p>"I have come to say good-bye," he
said, and the tone of his voice had
changed.</p>

<p>"Good-bye?" she repeated, and she
gave him her hand without another
word.</p>

<p>"I would like to thank you for your
kindness to me," he said dully; "but&mdash;well,
perhaps some day you will understand
what I feel now. I know you are
too good for me. I don't see why you
should ever have cared for me; but oh!
my little Stéphanie, you are just all the
world to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice broke, and he turned away
down one of the little sunny paths. But
there amongst the roses love came to him
at last; for Stéphanie, with a sudden
radiance in her face which sent all the
pride away, ran after him, and he, seeing
the radiance, straightway took her into
his arms, and the scent of the roses grew
sweet to him again.</p>

<p>And all the explanation mademoiselle
ever saw fit to give of her many unkind
moods was&mdash;"You were so masterful,
monsieur. You hammered out love, love,
love, and 'you must,' and 'you shall'&mdash;till
that day&mdash;then you wooed me as I
would that I should be wooed."</p>

<p>And he, remembering the words he
had overheard when he stood beneath
the garden wall, smiled and thought he
understood.</p>

<p>Not all peace was his wooing even
now.</p>

<p>His little mistress still had her moods,
and was tantalisingly chary of her soft
words and caresses. Moreover, she
possessed a will that had never been
thwarted, and she did not understand
the words "shall" and "must," never
having had them said to her.</p>

<p>So that, sweet as he found his wooing,
at times his brow grew dark; for he too
had a strong will, and it irked him to
have to make it give way to hers.</p>

<p>And at last there came a matter in
which he would not yield, and so they
parted.</p>

<p>For mademoiselle declared that always
must Ancelles be her home.</p>

<p>"When you are my wife," he said, "you
must come with me to my house in town&mdash;in
London, you know. What a change
it will be for you, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</i>!"</p>

<p>And then mademoiselle, her eyes kindling,
declared that never would she live
elsewhere than at Ancelles.</p>

<p>He was aghast. For to a man, strong
of limb and strong of brain, the life that
was a dream amongst the roses could
not suffice.</p>

<p>In vain he urged his views upon her.
She rebelled against his tone of authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
At last she stood before him with head
erect, and eyes that flashed on him from
under their long lashes.</p>

<p>"Choose," she said peremptorily:
"London or me."</p>

<p>"But, child, hear me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not hear you. Pray choose at
once."</p>

<p>"I would have both&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a little scornful laugh she bade
him begone.</p>

<p>"Stéphanie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She waved her white hand towards the
gates of Ancelles.</p>

<p>"You have chosen. Adieu!"</p>

<p>She turned away with a scornful smile
on her lips.</p>

<p>He sprang forward.</p>

<p>"Stéphanie, you must&mdash;you <em>shall</em> give
way to me in this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her small hand clenched.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, allow me to pass!"</p>

<p>He stood aside.</p>

<p>"You will repent," he said.</p>

<p>For an instant she turned her great
eyes dark with pride on him.</p>

<p>"<em>Never!</em>" she said, and walked away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Ancelles the roses still blossomed,
the sun still shone, though not so
hotly, on the little twisting paths, the
water nymph still bent gracefully for
her dive, and amongst them all flitted
their little mistress. In and out, gayer,
more restless, swifter of foot than even
of yore, she wended her way&mdash;a laugh
ever on her lips, merry words tripping
from her tongue, and hovering near&mdash;Jeannette.</p>

<p>"Life is good, Jeannette," cried mademoiselle,
and gaily she made herself a
crown of roses.</p>

<p>"Life with love&mdash;yes, mamzelle," murmured
Jeannette, for she was getting
desperate over the problem as to how
long a young girl could live eating
nothing, or next to nothing.</p>

<p>"Love? Bah! Jeannette, what an old
sentimentalist you are!"</p>

<p>Yet Jeannette had heard the sharp,
indrawn breath that preceded the mocking
words.</p>

<p>And why did mamzelle have to rest
half-way up to her room now?</p>

<p>Jeannette had seen her again and
again, yet never with mademoiselle's
knowledge.</p>

<p>For if Jeannette were with her, then,
setting her little white teeth closely,
mademoiselle did the flights of stairs
without a pause; but Jeannette saw
how the small hand, once so disdainful
of the balusters, now clung to the
support. She saw how the pretty throat
throbbed, how her bosom heaved, and
how the colour left her face; and, seeing,
Jeannette's own face grew grey
and lined with care.</p>

<p>"It is a merry world," cried mademoiselle,
setting the crown of roses on her
pretty head, "and love is superfluous."</p>

<p>"So is pride, mamzelle."</p>

<p>Up went the small crowned head.</p>

<p>"Pride superfluous, Jeannette?" haughtily.
"Nay, it is but proper and right
for those of Ancelles."</p>

<p>Jeannette moistened her dry lips.</p>

<p>"It can be bought too dearly, mamzelle."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;do not understand, Jeannette.
Surely you are forgetting yourself?"</p>

<p>The eyes were dangerous, the lips
haughty, but Jeannette's love for her
charge overcame the long reserve and
terror of those last months.</p>

<p>"Mamzelle, mamzelle, listen to me!
He is a good man, and he loves you
well. Without him you will pine a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pine, Jeannette? <em>Pine?</em>" Suddenly
she caught the old servant's wrists between
her small, hot hands. "Jeannette,"
she whispered passionately, "never speak
so again! Do you hear? <em>I</em> pine&mdash;<em>I!</em> Am
I sad, Jeannette? Answer me! Are my
spirits low?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, mamzelle."</p>

<p>"Do I not work and read and play
as always?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes, mamzelle."</p>

<p>"Do I ever droop?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or sigh?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or weep?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then what made you speak so,
Jeannette?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not know, mamzelle."</p>

<p>Stéphanie dropped her wrist. Her eyes
were burning, her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>"Then never dare to speak so again,"
she said, and turned haughtily away.</p>

<p>And almost directly she burst into a
gay little song; and Jeannette, standing
listening, felt the slow tears of age dropping
one by one down her cheeks.</p>

<p>In London Hugh Michelhurst shouldered
his way amongst the busy throng in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
Piccadilly, and in the fog his thoughts
turned to the old sunny garden at
Ancelles. He sighed, then frowned as
if such sighing displeased him. His
mouth took a bitter curve as his thoughts
wandered back to the last time he had
stood on the little sunny paths amongst
the roses, with Stéphanie at his side.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>G. G. Manton</p>

<p class="center">She turned away with a scornful smile.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps it was because his thoughts
so often wandered in that direction that
his face seemed to have grown harder,
his mouth sterner.</p>

<p>"Four months!" he murmured, "twelve
months in a year&mdash;say, forty years&mdash;long
years! Forty years like these last four
months!"</p>

<p>"Forty years, forty years!" rang
mockingly in his ears.</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused.</p>

<p>"Forty or a hundred, I will never give
in!" he said, and his mouth looked almost
cruel in its set sternness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Spring had come. A soft, warm, early
spring that brought all the tender flowers
peeping out before their time.</p>

<p>And in the warm, trying spring Hugh
Michelhurst fell ill of a low fever.</p>

<p>At the end of May he rose from his sick
bed, and refused to be an invalid any
longer.</p>

<p>But his strength was gone from him.</p>

<p>One day he walked out into the country,
and his love was strong on him, so that
he bowed his head, and felt weak as a
child. And suddenly a scent was wafted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
to him on the breeze. He stood and lifted
his head to meet it, and his face worked.
On a little cottage red roses glowed before
their time. He had seen none since he
was in the old garden at Ancelles. He
stretched out his arms. "I give in," he
said, and he turned and retraced his steps
the way he had come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a little sunny path amongst the roses
he found her.</p>

<p>"My darling&mdash;my darling&mdash;I will live
here always&mdash;only live with me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice broke; he could say no more.</p>

<p>With a little fond cry she nestled close
to him.</p>

<p>"No, no," she whispered, "I will come
away to your London as you wish."</p>

<p>They sat on the steps leading to the
second terrace, and the water nymph
seemed to smile down on them as she
bent to take her dive. They sat side
by side, and mademoiselle's pretty head
rested against his shoulder.</p>

</div>

<p>"But, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</i>, you love your home
so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My home is wherever you are,
monsieur."</p>

<p>"You did not think so once, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chérie</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah! but then you were 'shall' and
'must'"&mdash;pouting&mdash;"and now&mdash;now you
are different."</p>

<p>He smiled tenderly. He thought he
understood now.</p>

<p>"We will live part of the year here
and part in London. There, my little
one&mdash;will that do?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, perfectly!"</p>

<p>"Come now for a
little walk," he said,
for he had something
in his mind.</p>

<p>He stopped in one
of the twisting paths
down which they had
so often wandered,
and looked at the
old château.</p>

<p>"That ivy is too
thick to be healthy,"
he said, "but" (sighing),
"you like it&mdash;it
must stop."</p>

<p>Now that same ivy
had been the cause
of their biggest
quarrel before that
last biggest one of
all.</p>

<p>"It shall be cut,"
cried mademoiselle,
smiling up at him,
"and at once!"</p>

<p>He looked down
into her eyes adoringly.</p>

<p>The scent of the
roses wrapped them
round with softest
sweetness.</p>

<p>He smiled at her
tenderly.</p>

<p>Yes, he understood
now. He had found
the way to rule her.</p>

<h2>GREAT ANNIVERSARIES.</h2>

<h3><em>IN APRIL.</em></h3>


<p>April claims an anniversary which all
Englishmen are presumed to honour.
April 23rd is St. George's Day, and St.
George is the patron saint of England.
Yet he was not, so far as we know, an Englishman.
He is said to have been a centurion
in the army of Diocletian, and to have been
roasted alive for pulling down a copy of the
decree ordering the infamous persecution
associated with Diocletian's name. That distinction
is disputed in the interests of
another person; but the fact remains that
St. George was held in conspicuous honour
by the early Church. His particular place as
the patron of the English dates from the
Crusades. The story of George and the
Dragon has no relation to the incident which
couples him to the English. Some authorities
have identified this St. George with a certain
George of Cappadocia, Arian Bishop of
Alexandria; but Mr. Baring-Gould rejects
with indignation the proposal to confound
the patron saint of England with a heretic.
We are on the ground, not of legend, but
of history, in recalling St. Anselm, Archbishop
of Canterbury,
who was born
about 1033. His
day is April 21st.</p>

</div>

<p>St. George's Day
has memories of
other people than
the legendary
slayer of the
dragon. On April
23rd, 1564, William
Shakespeare was
born; on April
23rd, 1616, he died.
These, then, are
anniversaries which
cannot be overlooked
by any
person who values literature. Our pride is
qualified by the thought that all the world of
intelligence has taken hold of Shakespeare;
he is the possession of educated mankind.
Cervantes does not come of our stock, but
in passing it may be permitted to remember
that he died on the same day of the same
year as Shakespeare. It was on St. George's
Day, 1850, too, that William Wordsworth,
poet laureate, died. The body of John Keble,
the poet of the Oxford Movement, was laid
to rest in Hursley churchyard on April 6th,
1866. He was deeply influenced by Wordsworth,
but his name still more definitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
suggests another English poet&mdash;the saintly
George Herbert. He, too, belongs to this
month, for he was born on April 3rd, 1593.</p>

</div>

<p>George Herbert was related to Lord Herbert
of Cherbury, whose friends included Thomas
Hobbes, of Malmesbury, one of the most
distinguished of English philosophers. Hobbes
was born on April 5th, 1588. The philosophy
afterwards associated with the names of
Locke, Hume, and
Priestley owed
much to Hobbes.
Hume himself&mdash;philosopher,
historian,
and servant
of the State&mdash;was
born at Edinburgh
on April
26th, 1711. Charles
Darwin, philosopher
and naturalist,
died this month
(April 19th, 1882).
Few Englishmen
have attained to
wider fame; few
have ever more profoundly
influenced human thought.</p>

</div>

<p>Robert Raikes, in virtue of his
work in prisons and his share in the
foundation of Sunday schools, deserves
long to be held in memory.
Born at Gloucester, he died there
suddenly on April 5th, 1811. Could
Raikes have looked into the future,
with what astonishment and joy he
would have marked the development
in the extent and spirit of this work,
which is indicated by the existence
of <span class="smcap">The Quiver</span> Medal Fund and its
rewards to veteran Sunday-school
workers! A more modern and a
greater philanthropist also belongs
to April. Anthony Ashley Cooper,
seventh Earl of Shaftesbury, was
born in Grosvenor Square on April
28th, 1801. In and out of Parliament, with a
zeal which no opposition and no disappointment
could repress, "the good Earl" worked
for the cause of the oppressed, the poor, the
sick, the sinful. He did much directly; perhaps
more by the stimulus of his example.</p>

</div>

<p>Of institutions associated with the month
of April, the Royal Academy is one of the
most conspicuous. The Society of Incorporated
Artists held their first exhibition at
the Society of Arts, Adelphi, on April 21st,
1760. From this
there sprang the
Royal Academy.
The first exhibition
of the Academicians
was held
in Pall Mall on
April 26th, 1769.
The British Museum
has its association
with this month,
for it was on April
5th, 1753, that Parliament
granted the
sum of £20,000 to
the daughters of Sir
Hans Sloane, in return
for the collections
which were
the basis of the museum's vast treasures.
The National Gallery also has its link with
April, for it was on April 9th, 1838, that
the present building in Trafalgar Square was
completed and opened.</p>

<p>April has many memories for citizens of
the United States. On April 17th, 1790, died
Benjamin Franklin, politician, economist,
and natural philosopher; in April, 1861,
began the long struggle between the Northern
and Southern States; and on April 14th, 1865,
Abraham Lincoln, perhaps the most striking
personality hitherto produced by the great
democracy, was shot by John Wilkes Booth.</p>

<h2>BROUGHT AGAIN FROM THE DEPTHS.</h2>

<h3><em>AN EASTERTIDE ADDRESS.</em></h3>

<p class="center">By the Very Rev. W. Lefroy, D.D., Dean of Norwich.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"Thou, which hast showed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me
up again from the depths of the earth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> lxxi. 20.</p></blockquote>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus022a.jpg" alt="H" width="100" height="136" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">Human history had seen
but its infancy
when the announcement
was
made that man
was "born unto
trouble, as the
sparks fly upward."
And ever
since the home of
the Arab chief
was devastated;
ever since the day
that Job's heart
was broken by the intelligence of the Sabean
slaughter of his sons and daughters, followed
by a conflagration which stripped him of
property, and made a pauper of a prince; ever
since, the dreary wail of woe rends the air, and
the requiem of life sobs and sighs like Eliphaz
the Temanite, "Man is born unto trouble."</p>
</div>

<p>Nor can we allow ourselves to question the
dictum. The infant's wail precedes the infant's
weal. The cry of helplessness is heard in the
cradle. The child's deep sigh anticipates
the child's sweet smile. And although sunny
childhood sometimes passes as if the pitiless
law of hereditary trouble were suspended, yet
no serious thinker can hesitate to accept the
proposition, that trouble is in the ratio in
which life's meaning and purpose are experienced,
or divine love accepted and enjoyed.
If a man has no trouble, it is because he has
not yet practically realised the significance of
existence. He is still free from those social,
domestic, and personal influences, the derangement
of any of which brings agony
by day and sleeplessness by night. Or,
again, it may be because he has learnt the
loftiest and yet the lowliest lesson from his
Lord, by accepting the Gospel of Gethsemane,
"Thy will be done." But excepting the
persons so classified by social isolation or
spiritual resignation, there is not on earth
an exception to the law of the human race
being "born unto trouble." Yea, more. Constituted
as we are, we live in the presence
of the grim enigma, that the object which
gave us the highest joy can give us the most
excruciating sorrow. Nor can that existence
be anything else than mournful whose happiness
or misery depends upon any earthly
object.</p>

<p>This statement may be illustrated by
every condition in life&mdash;domestic, physical,
intellectual. The genius across whose mental
firmament the lights and shadows of history
travelled, and by whom they were arrested,
analysed, and grouped in their course;
the great brain of the great worker whose
intrepid excursions into the realms of the
past and the present, with a view to tabulating
the rise of civilisation&mdash;the patient and
profound Mr. Buckle, is absorbed by mental
enjoyment. He lives, and moves, and has
his being in men and manners, among maps
and manuscripts. He makes a grand discovery.
He keeps the secret for twenty years.
He repairs to Damascus to recruit for literary
service. He is stricken with fever, and dies
with the words of his intellectuality on his
parched lips, "My book, my book! I shall
never finish my book!" Here his highest
joy was his keenest sorrow. So in physical
life. There have been men who seemed at
one time as if they were created without
nerves. Their arms were brawny, muscular,
and mighty. Their limbs were firm and fine.
They seemed God's highest type of organic
life. They rejoiced in their strength and in
their youth. But disease assailed, or dissipation
punished, and retribution appeared in
feebleness, exhaustion, and debility. Youthful
feats were forbidden. The sports of the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
recalled a youth of virtue and purity; and
then came the sigh which told that, even
physically, the source of our joy becomes
the spring of our sorrow. And need I
elaborate details to establish the place of
this doctrine in domestic life? Do we not
know this from the gloomy history of the
orphan child, the widowed mother, the
bereaved sister, brother, friend? You know
that to love dearly means to have a skeleton
in your house. The object of your love causes
a thousand smiles to play in your eye, and to
break on your countenance; but the shade
of that object is mocking your mirth, and is
only waiting a few rounds of the clock to
compensate mirth with misery.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. There are sorrows far more
terrible than those of sickness or the cemetery.
A living sorrow defies rivalry. It has a
fearful pre-eminence in woe. A wayward, wild,
debauched youth; an estranged husband; an
embittered, irascible, worldly wife; a stormy,
or, what is far worse, a sullen home; these
are amongst the darkest illustrations of the
doctrine, that our sighs are in the track of
our smiles; our delights become our dangers;
yea, it sometimes seems as if affection became
idiotic, and then, like the raving maniac, we
laugh and cry together. So we are "born to
trouble." This being so, it is important to
listen to testimony concerning the remedy
which troubled souls have found efficacious.
If we have one such man, able and willing to
give his fellow-sufferers a cure for care, it is
surely prudent to hear what he has to say.
Accordingly, let me ask you to follow me
while I try to establish a cure for all afflicted
souls from the experience, conviction, and
anticipation of a royal mourner. I invite you
to come with me to the side of a man like one
of us. Listen to him struggling up the great
altar-stairs of faith sustained by love, and, as
he peers into the Unseen, he speaks as if to
one warm with life, charged with ardent
sympathy, and he says, "Oh, what troubles
and adversities hast Thou shown me; and yet
didst Thou turn and refresh me!"</p>

<p>The first step in this study is to be clear as
to the nature of the troubles God showed
David. There was, then, the personal and the
spiritual trouble of backsliding, consequent
upon his murder of Uriah for his base purpose.
And here we must discriminate. The trouble
of David about Bathsheba was not sent
by God; God permitted it; but in the
heartless and cold-blooded plot in the
tyrannical insolence and diabolical dastardliness
of its execution&mdash;in the coarse, callous,
and criminal height of its succeeding guilty
rapture&mdash;it was of Satan, of sin, of David.
For three-quarters of a year David played
fast and loose with God and conscience; and
it was when Nathan scared him that God
showed him the trouble. Then came anguish,
remorse, penitence. Then came the sorrowful
sighing of the soul&mdash;all the greater in the
awakening because it had slept so soundly
and so long. Then came that lamentation over
lost virtue, the penitential Fifty-first Psalm. It
is the expression of a man lacerated by conscience.
He seems to bleed at every pore.
The agitation and alarm and agony are piteous
beyond description. He appears in this
psalm to look in every direction, and the
ghost of his crime haunts him. Within, without,
above, below, behind, beyond, he can
see the furies of justice as the embassied
troublers of his life. Original depravity,
actual outrage, a heart black with the
Egyptian darkness of fostered treachery,
the warrior slaughtered by his mandate, the
blood-guiltiness staining his soul, and then
the wail ringing in the ears of God, "Cast
me not away from Thy presence; and take
not Thy Holy Spirit from me"&mdash;all these
may be compared to a spiritual chamber of
horrors, in which David found himself after
the startling visit of Nathan.</p>

<p>These were some of the troubles God
showed him. And their cause introduced
more of a domestic, not to say of a political,
kind. The sin brought scandal and reproach
on the Church of God. The enemies
blasphemed. Then Jehovah, vindicating His
character for justice before the world, avenging
the atrocious murder of Uriah, sent
a series of domestic afflictions upon David
unparalleled in human experience. One scene&mdash;a
nameless scene&mdash;has its miserable match
in the brutal bestiality of the Empire, when
the sceptre of Rome was in the hands of a
corpse. But the other experiences are easily
related. They are as the outcome of a
curse which hung heavily on the royal
house. Amnon, the eldest son, was slain
by young Absalom, who waited two years
for an opportunity. This severed Absalom
from home for three years. He then, by a
singular artifice, returned, and won the
hearts of the people by his consummate and
accomplished address, his handsome presence,
and adroit demeanour. His aged and royal
father's statesmen proved false to the king,
and one in particular advised the murder
of David and a revolution. At length the
conspiracy grew in defiance and dimension.
David was obliged to flee from the capital.
His flight was far more humiliating than
that of the French emperor from Paris.
Napoleon had not to mourn over the treason
of his son as the cause of his exile. This
was David's anguish. He ascended the
Mount of Olives and looked back upon the
city of palaces he had founded and ornamented&mdash;the
seat for a generation of his
power, his glory, his happiness. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
leaving it a miserable fugitive, driven forth
by the nation he had established and the
child he had reared. He could not, he did
not, disguise his sorrow. With bared head
and uncovered feet the exile began his
pilgrimage, and every step the old king
took recalled the crime and sin of earlier
years, while it remained for one Shimei to
load him with the bitterest and most contemptuous
execrations. Then came the crisis.
Such of the army as remained loyal engaged
in battle with the revolutionary forces
attracted to Absalom. David begged that
his unhappy son might be spared in the
conflict. The war began and issued in the
success of the royalists. The first question
of the venerable monarch was, "Is the
young man Absalom safe?" He then learnt
that order was re-established, but at the
cost of Absalom's life. He was accidentally
hanged, and while hanging he was speared
by David's commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>These are amongst the troubles&mdash;political,
domestic, and spiritual&mdash;which God permitted
to fall upon David; and yet this
very David has courage amid the havoc
of holiness, the misery of exile, the torture
of outraged parental affection, and
political insurrection. That courageous confidence
is in a person: he realises God.
This conviction is unshaken amid his
chequered life and history; indeed, all
through the din of revolution, the grief of
a homeless and worse than childless existence,
there is one ever-recurring belief:
"God my help," "God my refuge," "God
my shield." In this belief he brings back
to God every trouble God sent to him.
Hence we have these psalms, written by
David, as agony after agony swept in upon
his soul. Nor did it seem to signify how
different one sorrow might be from another.
The old cry, the same cry, is raised to a
personal God. When Saul sought his life
through jealousy; when Jonathan was slain
in battle; when he himself had fallen into
sin, and then was aroused&mdash;now by the
whisperings of reclaiming grace, now by the
booming billows of divine justice; when he
bowed his head in shame, and the fierce
light that beat about his court gleamed on
his dark soul; when he tottered up the
heights of Olivet, an impotent outcast,
betrayed by his courtiers, deserted by his
troops, and exiled by the unnatural rebellion
and heartless perfidy of his son&mdash;in these
experiences, so fearful, overwhelming, and
varied, he saw God showing him the trouble.
As the hand that sent it was ever the
same, so from the heart that received it
there arose ever and anon the same plea&mdash;"Have
mercy upon me, O Lord"; "Make
haste to help me"; "O Lord, make no
long tarrying"; "I am poor and needy";
"O be not Thou far from me, for trouble
is near at hand." And then, as if realising
the apostasy, desertion, and faithlessness of
his friends and forces, he adds, "There is
none to help."</p>

<p>We know how these earnest and anxious entreaties
were heard: "Thou didst turn and refresh
me"; "Through Thee have I been holden
up ever since I was born"; "My mouth shall
speak of Thy salvation all the day long; for
I know no end thereof." But further. This
acknowledgment of God as a "very present
help in trouble" is followed by a prophecy, and
that of nothing less than the resurrection&mdash;"Thou
shalt bring me up again from the depths
of the earth"; so that David's sorrow, when
brought humbly and heartily to God, was
followed by divine refreshment then, and hope
of resurrection hereafter. And a well-founded
hope it was, because the trouble sent by God
produced a grand moral result when laid before
Him Who sent it. It had a purifying influence
which made his mind speed on to the resurrection
day. In its anticipation he was but
yielding to the influence of a life higher than
that he lived before his sorrow, and which
sought enjoyment and exercise loftier and
still loftier. This he, by faith, foresaw, in
the anticipation of that rest to which his
trouble sent him, and for the appreciation of
which his trouble purified him.</p>

<p>So we have here in the spiritual world an
instructive and encouraging illustration of
what frequently occurs in the physical. We
have purification by pain; refreshment out of
ruin. So have I seen this grand law asserting
the governance of its God in those Alpine
crags on which the stars seem to pause.
There on those storm-scalped peaks the
climber feasts on the panorama spread by
God's own hand, in winding river, sapphire
lake, everlasting hill, sentinelled by a forest
of pines, dressed in the matchless sombre of
Alpine green or shrouded by the spotless
snows of heaven. I have witnessed the
troubles of the atmosphere. The bursting
rain-cloud hangs low, the light recedes, the
darkness deepens, the wind moans; and then
the full-toned thunder roars, and the long
lines of fire, angular and electric, leap from
fissures in the firmament. The artillery of the
elements is deafening, and its echoes rumble
in the distance like the mutterings of imprisoned
spirits. The storm is over. The calm
succeeds. The clouds become brighter and
brighter still. The sun peeps out here and
there in a rift of the heavens. The air is
fresh and keen and pure. The vegetation is
bright and green. The rivulets and mountain
torrents ripple and rush rejoicing. As we
see this, we are reminded of the analogies of
God's government; yea, if we could put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
preacher on every peak, a tongue in every
valley, Nature would minister to grace, and
from each would come the response of the
royal poet to the call of God. The world
physical would raise the ecstatic antiphon to
the world spiritual: "O what great troubles
and adversities hast Thou showed me, and yet
didst Thou turn and refresh me!"</p>

<p>But these words have a still richer meaning
in their bearing upon the religious fortunes
of the Hebrew race, the Messianic glory of the
Redeemer, and the present and future position
of His believing people. I believe that Israel's
troubles are to issue in Israel's refreshment,
and even in national resurrection. Her captivities
and dispersions, her degradation and
exile, are but the preludes to her rise, return,
and splendour. God has sworn it; His word
is bound to it. His promise is as certain as
though it were performed. But we may
merely mention this as a conviction, in order
to pass on and recognise in these words the
history of Jesus Christ. From that cradle
and cottage home; from that carpenter's bench
where He toiled; from that country, with its
hills and dales, and lanes and lakes, where He
preached; from the Temple which He glorified
and abrogated; from the cross where He died;
from the tomb which He vacated; from the
throne of mediation, where He sympathises,
intercedes and governs; from earth below, and
heaven above, the voice of Jesus sounds o'er
land and sea, filling angelic souls with adoration,
and human hearts with hope, announcing,
"O what great troubles and adversities hast
Thou showed Me!" He was betrayed, despised,
and rejected. He looked for some to have pity
on Him, but there was no man; neither found
He any to comfort Him. He was maligned and
misunderstood. The malice of His enemies
omitted but one sin in their resolve to blacken
His character, and it remained for the patronising
blasphemy of Renan to insinuate that
one as possible. He was accused of deceit,
though infallible; He was slandered as a
drunkard, though immaculate; yea, the detraction
of His foes did not spare Him the
agony of being charged with the commission
of a sin as disgusting as it is brutal&mdash;that of
gluttony. He was arraigned as a felon, and
died as an impostor. But beyond all was the
sin of which these were but the symptoms.
This was the trouble, "great and sore," which
God showed Him. This was the agony of
agonies to the sinless, spotless Lamb of God.
Its fell pressure is the meaning of the tradition
that Jesus was often seen to weep, but never
once to smile. To this trouble we trace the
overpowering experiences of the fainting,
prostrate Christ in the garden; of the wailing
and woe-bearing Christ on the cross. Yet
there was the refreshment; there was behind
it all the unchangeable love of God the Father&mdash;"Therefore
doth My Father love Me, because
I lay down My Life that I might take it again."
There was the satisfaction of His soul, in saving
the race He died to redeem by representation;
there was, above all, the guarantee of
that redemption in being brought "from the
depths of the earth again."</p>

<p>And if we were to follow the history of His
Church, that history would be a living commentary
on the experience of David and of
David's Lord: divinely sent trouble, divinely
sought and divinely sent refreshment, issuing
in spiritual resurrection. Is not this the account
many have to give of sorrow, succour,
and salvation? You were weak: you are
now strong. You were "choked with cares,"
and sought relief in a flood of tears: you are
now able to leave the burden of your cares
with Him Who "careth for you"; while your
eyes, once red with agony, are now bright
with praise, gratitude, and hope. Remembering
what you were, and now recognising
what you are, you may adopt the language of
David, "I am become a wonder unto many,
but my sure trust is in Thee"; or, taking
a fuller view and a finer tone, you will ring
out the litany of deliverance, and chant the
song of praise and blessing, "O what great
troubles and adversities has Thou showed
me; and yet didst Thou turn and refresh me."</p>

<p>This present refreshment is a prophecy of
future resurrection. It leads all the afflicted
children of God on to the grand climax in sin,
sorrow, and all the trouble to which we are
born. Then the cup of universal affliction shall
be full. The waters of our pilgrimage shall
be sweetened, and changed into the bright,
clear, rosy wine of immortality. Then farewell,
sorrow; farewell, weakness; agony, ache,
desolation, and sin, we bid you a final and a
glad farewell. Then shall rise upon this scene
of change and uncertainty, where pain and
pleasure are so intermingled and combined,
the sun that knows no setting, the everlasting
day that knows no night. Then shall the
children of God, the "children of the resurrection,"
gathered from every known and
unknown region, race, and age, rise to the
rapture of the saints, and, defying the immeasurable
weight of all the ocean's pressure&mdash;for
the sea shall give up its dead&mdash;shattering
the manacles with which corruption had long
bound the germ of incorruption, they shall
"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,"
greet the Saviour Who loved them, with a
greeting worthy the Lamb that was slain;
worthy the grandest event in the annals of
earth and heaven; while high above the din of
the last crash of worlds, yea, louder than the
storm which marches on the ruins of creation,
shall rise the anthem of royal and even wretched
and relieved experience&mdash;"Thou hast brought
me from the depths of the earth again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3><em>The Pity of It.</em></h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus026a.jpg" alt="O" width="100" height="107" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">On Saturday night, in
that same week,
Harold sallied forth
at dusk, with a
bulky brown-paper
parcel under his
arm, containing a
pair of boots which
he was taking by
stealth to a humble
cobbler in a back
alley to mend.</p>
</div>

<p>Just because he fervently desired not to
meet anybody he knew, as he turned a
corner he almost ran into the arms of May
Burnside; who, on seeing him, appeared confused.
He stopped and tried to conceal his
parcel as well as he could, whilst talking
volubly; and May stammered and fidgeted,
like one detected in a guilty enterprise. Her
aunt had that day presented her with half-a-crown;
and, wishing to make a frock for
Doris, she was on her way to buy some
wonderful material she had seen marked
fourpence three-farthings in a cheap, common
shop she would not have cared to enter by
daylight. Miss Waller would have fainted at
the idea of her niece being seen going into
Whittaker's, where everything was ticketed
"Alarming Sacrifice!"</p>

<p>So, the boots weighing on his uneasy conscience,
and the fourpence three-farthings on
hers, they continued to blush and stammer
until Harold summoned up courage to say
that it was rather late, and, if Mrs. Burnside
was going home, he would escort her, if she
wished.</p>

<p>She hesitated, loth to lose the chance of
bargain, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My aunt is dining out, so I need not hurry
back; and I wanted to go to a shop&mdash;Whittaker's,
do you know it? I buy rubbish there
occasionally."</p>

<p>He did know the shop, which was close to
the alley wherein dwelt his old cobbler. "If
you don't mind," he said eagerly, "I'll leave
you a moment, whilst I do an errand hard by,
and meet you when you've done your shopping."</p>

<p>So he went off, delighted at solving the
problem of the boots; for no man appears to
advantage when hugging a clumsy parcel.
Having duly effected her purchase, May rejoined
him, and, as they strolled towards Victoria
Square, informed him that they were
starting for London on Monday. "I know
I shall hate it!" she added, with a sigh.</p>

<p>He sighed too; but what could he say or
do, bound as he was, hand and foot? "July
<em>is</em> rather hot for London," he answered discreetly.
"Lulu wrote yesterday, and may I
suggest, if you have leisure, she would be
delighted if you called to see her? I will give
you her address. The flat is very tiny, of
course, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But infinitely preferable, I am sure, to
Victoria Square!" retorted May bitterly. The
burden of life seemed intolerable that evening.</p>

<p>"Are you, then, so unhappy there?" he
asked, startled. "How I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself hastily, and May stifled
a sob which rose in her throat. "Very few
people are quite happy, it seems to me," she
said, trying to speak calmly. "There is
always something."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you&mdash;<em>you</em> ought to be happy, if
there were any justice in the world!" he
burst out impetuously. "You deserve a sunny,
sheltered life, free from worry and care. Will
you believe it is the hardest of my trials
to be able to offer you nothing but barren
sympathy?"</p>

<p>"It is very good of you to sympathise with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
me," May murmured gratefully. "So few
people do. They look at my clothes, and
decide that anybody dressed as I am, and
living in Victoria Square, <em>must</em> be happy.
'Lucky Mrs. Burnside!' they call me."</p>

<p>He remembered how enviable, in the early
days of their acquaintance, May had seemed
to him, and thought how mistaken are the
judgments of this world. A great pity swelled
his heart as she said "Good-bye"; and he
tramped back to his dreary rooms doubly depressed,
both on her account and his own.
How he longed to be able to free her from
her shackles, and offer her a happy home,
independent of Miss Waller!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I must say, May, nobody would think
you were going to London to enjoy yourself.
Do, for goodness' sake, try to look a
little more cheerful!" said Miss Waller
sharply, as they took their seats in a reserved
first-class carriage on the Monday.
Mr. Lang, to May's great relief, had returned
to town three days before, so they were
spared his company. "You are the most
ungrateful girl I ever knew."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus027.jpg" width="250" height="362" alt="Grumpy" />
<div class="caption"><p>"Do try to look a little more cheerful!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I'm sorry you think so, aunt, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It would serve you right if I washed
my hands of you entirely," continued the
irate spinster. "But I am too kind-hearted;
my sense of duty restrains me. I should be
better off now, if I'd been more selfish
and less considerate for others. But I'm well
aware it's useless to expect
gratitude in <em>this</em> world."</p>

<p>And, with a heartfelt sigh
for the wickedness of this
generation, Miss Waller arranged
the air-cushion more
comfortably at her back, and,
placing her daintily shod feet on
the opposite seat, commenced
to study a newspaper. May
sat watching the deep-green
summer landscape flit by, with
pretty much the same feelings
as a convict might experience
while going down to Portland
guarded by warders. The knowledge
that Mr. Lang awaited
them at the end of the journey
took all the colour out of the
blue sky; and the sleek cattle
standing knee-deep in water
beneath the willows, seemed to
mock her by their animal freedom
from care. For herself,
she cared little; but there was
Doris to consider, and the
thought of her helpless child
harassed her throughout that
miserable journey.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3><em>The Recluse.</em></h3>


<p>Enforced idleness is, to
an active mind, the
greatest misery conceivable.
Harold Inglis
had in him a vast capacity for
work, and therefore found it
doubly bitter to have to spend
his days lounging about, waiting
for the patients who never came. He
was afraid to go out lest he should miss a
summons, and unable to sit down to read
or write, so continually did he find himself
listening for a ring at the bell and
Ann's voice announcing a patient. He
could not even tranquillise himself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
tobacco, for he had given up smoking on
account of the expense.</p>

<p>He returned from an errand one afternoon
to find an elderly manservant waiting with
the intimation that Sir Edward Vane, of The
Towers, was ill, and would like to see him.
He knew Sir Edward by name as a wealthy
and eccentric recluse, who lived alone in a
big house just outside the town, and was
liberal in doctors' fees. Not a little flattered,
he promised to come immediately, and was
about to turn in at the lodge gate at The
Towers, when he encountered Dr. Selwyn,
another local medical man, with whom he
was acquainted.</p>

<p>"Been sent for by Sir Edward, eh?" asked
Selwyn, with a broad grin.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Wish you joy. You may not know it,
but he's already tried every doctor in Beachbourne,
and quarrelled with them all in
succession. I wouldn't attend him again for
any money. Good-bye, and good luck to you!"</p>

<p>In some trepidation, Harold knocked, and
was admitted through a handsome hall into
a spacious sitting-room, littered with almost
every conceivable object. On a sofa reclined
a grey-haired man about sixty, whose tanned
face, speaking of long residence in the tropics,
was disfigured by a look of fretful ill-health.
A retired Anglo-Indian, distinguished in the
Civil Service, Sir Edward had seen more of
the world than most men.</p>

<p>"You're not in partnership with anybody
here, are you?" he asked, when Harold had
examined him carefully.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"All the better. A more wretched lot of
impostors than the Beachbourne doctors I
never came across. For years they've been
tinkering at me, and, after all, I'm worse,
instead of better. What are doctors for, if
they can't cure one?"</p>

<p>Harold was discreetly silent. Sir Edward
had a complication of maladies, beyond any
medical skill to remedy.</p>

<p>"My father lived to be ninety," continued
the invalid. "And why can't I?"</p>

<p>"I don't think, for my part, I should wish
to be so old as that," diffidently returned
Harold. "It must be so sad to outlive all
one's friends."</p>

<p>"I have no friends," was the grim reply.
"Only some greedy relations, eager for my
money. I've a good deal to leave," he
added, looking keenly at Harold. "And
when I take a fancy to people, I'm liberal&mdash;&mdash;They
say here that I'm always quarrelling
with my doctors; but it's the doctors who
quarrel with me, and will air their own
particular fads, instead of trying to cure me.
Are you married?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"A good thing, too; you've more time to
attend to your patients. Hewett used to bore
me talking by the hour about that ugly wife
of his. Do you understand fossils, and such
things? My room's in an awful mess, as you
see, and I should like to have the specimens
arranged a bit; but I can't trust the servants."</p>

<p>The place was indeed crammed with all
sorts of curios, many exceedingly valuable.
By continually asking for one possession after
another, Sir Edward had ended by accumulating
all his treasures in this one room,
which he never left, save for his bedchamber
adjoining. A most untidy place it was; the
curiosities being heaped on chairs, shelves,
and the floor, without any method.</p>

<p>"I am very fond of fossils; and if you
wish them arranged, it would give me great
pleasure to help."</p>

<p>"Hewett wanted me to make a clean sweep
of them; interfered with the flow of his
precious fresh air. Like his ignorance! Did
he think I wanted to sit and stare at an
ugly wall-paper all day when I was tired
of reading?"</p>

<p>"Do you read much?"</p>

<p>"Yes; chiefly Sanskrit. In <em>my</em> day, Indian
officials had to be not only gentlemen but
scholars. Well," as Harold rose to go, "I'll
have your prescription made up, and shall
expect you again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I will come, and hope the pain will be
easier then." He detailed the treatment he
desired, and was giving a few final directions
when the manservant opened the door. "Miss
Geare has called, sir. Will you see her?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" pettishly exclaimed Sir Edward.
"She'll stay an hour, prosing about her dogs.
For mercy's sake, don't go!" detaining
Harold. "Help me to entertain her, and get
her away soon! She was to have been my
sister-in-law, having been engaged to my
brother Adrian years ago; and since in an
evil hour I settled at Beachbourne, I've been
fairly persecuted by her."</p>

<p>In another minute the little lady tripped
smilingly in.</p>

<p>"Well, Edward dear, how are you now?
I heard you were not well, so I just came
to inquire."</p>

<p>"I'm better now, thank you," returned Sir
Edward gruffly. "I've given Hewett the
sack, and this is my new doctor&mdash;Dr. Inglis.
Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he has been attending me. I'm
sure he has done me good, and I hope you'll
benefit also, Edward. You can't <em>think</em> how
kind Dr. Inglis was to my darling Bijou
when he broke his leg!"</p>

<p>"Having attended Bijou, it, of course, follows
that Dr. Inglis will cure me," sneered
Sir Edward. "How is the amiable Miss
Pepper?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's waiting outside with the dogs, as
you said you wouldn't have her here. She's
a faithful creature; I wish you liked her a
little better, Edward dear."</p>

<p>"I never was fond of vinegar, Catherine."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be so sarcastic, Edward! I never
was clever; but you make me feel like a little
girl again, when my governess scolded me."</p>

<p>There were tears in the watery blue eyes;
but they did not seem to touch Sir Edward.
"The remedy, my dear Catherine, is exceedingly
simple," he blandly rejoined. "I know
I'm a curmudgeon, unfit to associate with
such an angel as you. Why then should you
inflict upon yourself the unpleasantness of
coming here? Why not stay away, to enjoy
the more congenial society of Miss Pepper
and the dogs?"</p>

<p>"So you don't want me, Edward? I think
you're very unkind," returned Miss Geare,
evidently wounded, but with a patient dignity
Harold had not expected. He noticed
that ever since she entered her gaze had
wandered, at intervals, to an oil-painting of
a fine-looking young man in uniform which
hung over the mantelpiece. "But I know
better than to take you at your word. You
are all I have left&mdash;my dear Adrian's brother&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
She broke down, and wiped the
slow tears of age from her eyes.</p>

<p>Sir Edward gave an impatient sigh, and
Harold interposed. "Allow me to remind
you, Miss Geare, that my patient has had a
very severe attack, and the quieter he is the
better. Everything depends on that. I must
go home now; and may I request the pleasure
of your company to the gate, if you
are ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do go home to Bijou!" fretfully
murmured the invalid. And Miss Geare, after
bestowing an affectionate farewell on the unresponsive
Sir Edward, allowed Harold to
politely conduct her to the lodge gate.</p>

<p>"Poor Edward!" she began, as they went
down the drive, "he allows illness to sour
his temper, and it's such a pity! But I take
no notice&mdash;he's my dear Adrian's only brother,
and I can't bear to stay away from the house.
Did you see the portrait over the mantelpiece?&mdash;that
was my Adrian. I was young, and
pretty too, in those days, though you mayn't
believe it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I quite believe it," said Harold kindly,
touched by the spectacle of this forlorn old
age.</p>

<p>"Adrian was so proud of Edward. He was
so much thought of in India, and is very,
very clever&mdash;but not equal to my Adrian&mdash;oh,
no; nobody ever could be as handsome and
noble as he was! When I heard he was killed
in the Mutiny, I thought I should die too;
I think it must have killed something inside
me, for I've never been the same since. I
get confused, and I can't remember things&mdash;&mdash;Yes,
I'm coming. Very sorry to have kept you
waiting."</p>

<p>The humble apology was to Miss Pepper,
who, with a most unamiable countenance,
was standing just outside the gate. Miss
Geare hastily said farewell, and Harold
could hear her companion scolding her vigorously
as they went down the road. But, as
he thought of the faded, antique love story
which had ended so tragically, he could not
but feel sorry for poor little eccentric Miss
Geare&mdash;it was so evident that the best part
of her had been buried in her lover's grave.
Her eyes must have been rather like May's,
he thought, before sorrow had given them
that vacant expression; and then he wondered,
for the hundredth time, what Mrs.
Burnside was doing in London, and whether
she thought of him as often as he did of her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vanitas Vanitatum.</i></h3>


<p>Arrived in London, all May's worst
anticipations were realised; for Mr.
Lang accompanied them everywhere,
and she had not a minute to call
her own. He assumed an air of proprietorship
which made her blood boil. "You ought
to do this, Mrs. Burnside&mdash;you should see
that," he repeated from morning till night;
and, as Miss Waller invariably pronounced
all his suggestions charming, it was useless
for May to rebel.</p>

<p>So London proved the same weary old
story over again&mdash;a life of outward glitter and
show, of softly rolling carriages, of sumptuous
dinners, and reserved seats; and within, dust
and ashes, and Dead Sea fruit! May talked
and smiled, but it was mechanically; her
heart was far away.</p>

<p>She asserted herself sufficiently, however,
to declare her intention of calling upon the
Inglis girls in their flat in West Kensington.
She had written to Lulu, who sent her a
pressing invitation to come on Saturday
afternoon, when they were at leisure.</p>

<p>Miss Waller instantly denounced the scheme
as a wild-goose chase, asserting that May was
certain to lose her way. They were still
discussing it when Mr. Lang came in from
Palace Gardens, as he usually did first thing
in the morning, ostensibly to ask what they
wished to do, but really to order them about
at his sovereign will and pleasure. "Well,
ladies, what's the programme for to-day?" he
began.</p>

<p>May turned round from the window of the
handsome drawing-room for which her aunt
was paying a small fortune, thinking, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
morning sunlight fell upon his podgy figure,
that Mr. Lang grew uglier and more common-looking
every day. "I have promised to go
and see my friends the Inglises this afternoon,"
she announced firmly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus030.jpg" width="450" height="386" alt="doctor" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"This is my new doctor&mdash;Dr. Inglis."&mdash;<em>p. 509.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>"And who may the Inglises be?"</p>

<p>"Some girls who live at West Kensington,"
returned May, colouring at his lordly
tone.</p>

<p>"Their brother is a doctor&mdash;a very unsuccessful
one at Beachbourne," put in Miss
Waller irritably. "They are very poor, and
live in a poky flat. What May can see in
them I can't imagine; and I'm sure she'll
get lost if she goes alone."</p>

<p>"I can take a cab, aunt." By a perfect
miracle she had a few shillings in her pocket.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," pompously proclaimed
Mr. Lang. "You shall go in a cab, Mrs.
Burnside, if you really must, and I'll call and
bring you back in my carriage. Eh, Miss
Waller?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a splendid idea!" gushed the
spinster, brightening; and, though May protested
earnestly against troubling Mr. Lang,
he was resolute. Then he carried them off
to inspect a picture in a Bond Street shop
which took his fancy&mdash;a seapiece, with
violently ultramarine waves tumbling about
the canvas. May considered it a most irritating
production, and boldly said so; for,
despite her aunt's frowns, she refused to
flatter Mr. Lang. He took her criticism very
good-naturedly, however, and insisted on their
coming to luncheon with him at a fashionable
Regent Street restaurant,
where only African
millionaires and suchlike
could afford to go.</p>

<p>But at length May's ordeal was over, and
she drew a great breath of relief as the lift
deposited her at No. 18, Windermere Mansions.
Lulu herself admitted her, evidently delighted
to see her, and announced that just then she
was alone.</p>

<p>"Esther isn't back yet, but I expect her
every minute," she explained. "Mabel, our
chum, has gone to see some friends. We
don't keep a servant, but a charwoman comes
morning and evening. Our flat is a mere
cupboard, as you see; but, such as it is, you
are very welcome."</p>

<p>She conducted May over it, and tiny
it certainly was; only one sitting-room, a
speck of a kitchen, three small bedrooms,
and a bathroom. But it was very comfortable
and homelike; and, though many of
the articles were merely of wicker and
bamboo, it was furnished with a taste which
betrayed the instincts of gentlewomen.</p>

<p>"How I envy you!" exclaimed May, as she
sank into a chair in the cosy little sitting-room.
And then, to Lulu's consternation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
and to her own intense disgust, she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>Lulu looked quite alarmed; for the modern
girl reserves all such exhibitions for the
privacy of her own apartment, and tears and
hysterics are as much out of fashion nowadays
as poke bonnets and sandalled shoes.
It is not that the new girl can't feel, but
that she considers it undignified to cry.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus031.jpg" width="450" height="370" alt="tears" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">To Lulu's consternation ... she burst into tears.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Forgive me," apologised May, blushing
furiously. "I'm overtired&mdash;I've been doing
too much in this heat. I feel quite ashamed
to be so foolish."</p>

<p>"We'll have tea directly Esther comes;
that will revive you," replied Lulu cheerfully
and she proceeded to light a dainty spirit-kettle
which formed part of a most inviting
tea equipage. May watched her enviously,
thinking how sweet and homelike it all was.
She had never known a real home since
leaving her father's house. Her married life
was a horrible nightmare, and Victoria Square
was little better; and if she yielded to pressure
and married Mr. Lang&mdash;&mdash;But no!
that would not bear thinking of!</p>

<p>"There's Esther!" cried Lulu eagerly, as a
latch-key clicked in the hall door.</p>

<p>May had expected to find Miss Inglis
handsome; but she was not prepared for such
a young goddess as now swept into the
room, with a stride of long, well-knit limbs
which made the place seem ludicrously small.
Esther Inglis would have attracted notice
anywhere, with her splendid, keen-cut, dark
face and stately poise of head; and her
family might well be proud of her.</p>

<p>She was better dressed than Lulu, in a
plain but well-fitting gown which was very
becoming.</p>

<p>"Tired, dear?" asked Lulu affectionately,
as her sister, after greeting May, reclined
her tall figure in a basket-chair.</p>

<p>"Rather; that is, I've a Saturday afternoon
kind of feeling. The office was very hot, and
the new man can't quite manage the telephone.
Where's Mabel?"</p>

<p>"Gone to see her friends at Richmond.
Give me your hat, dear."</p>

<p>She removed her sister's outdoor garb with
a deft motherliness which charmed May.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
Miss Inglis was clearly accustomed to being
waited upon; but it seemed quite natural,
with her splendid face and figure.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3><em>Mr. Lang meets his Match.</em></h3>


<p>"And how is Harold, Mrs. Burnside?"
Esther asked as they sipped their tea.</p>

<p>May gave as favourable an account
of his progress as she could, to which
Miss Inglis listened thoughtfully. "I'm afraid
he has an uphill struggle before him, poor old
fellow! Without capital, it seems to me, you
can do nothing nowadays? Are there many
doctors at Beachbourne?"</p>

<p>"A good many; and, of course, it takes
time to make a practice."</p>

<p>"It's always the same old story&mdash;want
of money!" sighed Esther pessimistically.
"Nowadays the competition is something
dreadful; and what will it be for the next
generation?"</p>

<p>"Why, Esther, you seem in rather a croaking
mood!" remonstrated Lulu.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, going about daily in trains
and omnibuses, and having to run the
gauntlet of every man who thinks that
because a girl works for her living she can't
possibly be a lady, doesn't tend to sweeten
one's view of life."</p>

<p>"I suppose there are annoyances in every
lot," diffidently put in May. "But there are&mdash;there
really are&mdash;worse things than being
obliged to earn one's living. You must be
so happy here, able to do just as you like,
with nobody to worry you."</p>

<p>Esther's brow cleared. "Yes, it's something
to be independent, nowadays. And
it's too bad to bore you with my grumbles,
Mrs. Burnside. I don't often indulge in
complaints, do I, Lulu? We three really
have a jolly time here; and my salary is to
be raised twenty pounds a year, beginning
from next month."</p>

<p>"Oh, Esther, how splendid!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we must go on the river, or have
some dissipation to celebrate it. Oh! who
can that be?" as a loud knock resounded
at the outer door.</p>

<p>"My aunt thought I might get lost, and
a friend of ours&mdash;Mr. Lang&mdash;offered to call
for me," said May, flushing. "He is earlier
than I expected&mdash;I hope you don't mind his
coming?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no!" nonchalantly responded
Esther, as Lulu bustled out to admit Mr.
Lang, who entered with his usual bumptious
self-confidence. But when his eyes fell upon
the superb figure of Esther, he was palpably
surprised.</p>

<p>May introduced him; but, while Lulu gave
him a friendly greeting, Esther barely condescended
to acknowledge his existence. Miss
Inglis, late of Mallowfield Hall, was not to
be put down by a vulgar plutocrat.</p>

<p>"I must apologise for coming rather early,
Mrs. Burnside," he began, "but I didn't
quite know how long it would take to get
here; I never was in this neighbourhood
before. Don't you find it rather out of the
way?" he continued, addressing Esther.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> rather inconvenient, especially as
we don't keep a carriage," she coolly returned.
A keen observer of human nature,
she had taken Mr. Lang's measure in one
haughty glance.</p>

<p>"Nice little place, though," he added
patronisingly, intending to be very polite.
"That drapery over the mantelpiece is a
good idea. Did Liberty do it?"</p>

<p>"I did it myself, with a few yards of
cheap cretonne and an ounce of tin-tacks."</p>

<p>"Really! How clever!" he exclaimed, not
perceiving that Esther was covertly laughing
at him. "Old miniatures, too! Are you a collector?
I am; I've got some lovely Cosways."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! these are only some of
our ancestors. My father has the best ones,
down in Cornwall."</p>

<p>"I've rather a good collection at my
house in Palace Gardens. You've seen them,
haven't you, Mrs. Burnside? It would give
me great pleasure to show them to your
young friends, if they care to call some day."</p>

<p>"Thank you; my sister and I are working
all day, and have very little time. I am
not specially interested in miniatures, except
those belonging to our family," replied
Esther coldly. May inwardly rejoiced at
seeing Mr. Lang meet his match for once.</p>

<p>"I believe you have a brother out in
South Africa?" presently asked Mr. Lang,
turning to Lulu.</p>

<p>"Yes, at Johannesburg. He's on the staff
of the Victorina Mine."</p>

<p>"I believe I've met him somewhere.
Rather good-looking, with dark hair, isn't
he? He must know me; I'm so well known
out there in connection with the Springkloof
Mine. Have you heard of the Springkloof,
Miss Inglis?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered that superb young lady,
fixing her eyes steadily on him. "I have
heard a good deal about it from Jack. He
was over in England last summer."</p>

<p>"I'm often going backwards and forwards
to Johannesburg," continued Mr. Lang; "I
should be glad at any time to take charge
of any parcels or letters for your brother,
if you will let me know. This is my London
address," and he laid his card on the table.</p>

<p>"Thank you, we couldn't think of troubling
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>"No trouble, I assure you. I should be
very glad to oblige any&mdash;any of Mrs. Burnside's
friends."</p>

<p>May crimsoned beneath his significant
glance and the scarcely veiled scorn on
Esther's fine face. How these girls must
despise her for associating with this horrible
man! Unable to bear it any longer, she rose
to take leave.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall meet again before you
go," Lulu said wistfully; but May dared not
press them to come and see her aunt, knowing
they would only meet a chilly reception
from Miss Waller. "I will write and let
you know," she answered hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you young ladies might like a
drive in the Park occasionally?" suggested
Mr. Lang. "I'd be very happy to send my
carriage."</p>

<p>"Thank you," responded Esther, who appeared
to be spokeswoman on all occasions.
"My sister and I work for our living, and
have no time for such dissipations. I am
employed in a City office."</p>

<p>"Then it's a shame you should have to
work&mdash;that's all I can say," warmly rejoined
Mr. Lang. "A woman's place is at home,
in a handsome drawing-room, with every
comfort about her&mdash;not jostling about in the
crowd with men."</p>

<p>"Handsome drawing-rooms and an idle life
are not within the reach of every woman,
nowadays, Mr. Lang," coldly responded
Esther, as they shook hands; and the next
minute the door closed behind them.</p>

<p>"Horrid man!" cried Esther wrathfully,
when the visitors had gone. "Didn't his insufferable
patronage make your blood boil?
He might well ask if we knew him by name;
of course, we do&mdash;too well, for, according to
Jack, the Springkloof Mine was a byword
on the Randt, from the way in which the
original owners were cheated out of the
property by Mr. Lang and his syndicate. I
remember he mentioned this Lang as a man
who was well known at Johannesburg to
have mixed in many shady transactions."</p>

<p>"What a pity that nice Mrs. Burnside
should be obliged to associate with him! He
evidently admires her; but, to tell you a secret,
Esther, there's somebody who admires her
even more&mdash;and that's Harold."</p>

<p>"Poor Harold! How can he ever afford
to marry? Mrs. Burnside is dependent on
her aunt for everything, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and her aunt intends her to marry
Mr. Lang. Poor thing! I can see she is simply
miserable at the idea of it."</p>

<p>Esther took up Mr. Lang's card, to
read the address. "He might well say West
Kensington was out of the way! If he ever
comes again&mdash;I don't mean to be at home."
And she tore it into the smallest fragments.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3><em>On the Island.</em></h3>


<p>"This is what I call perfectly delightful,"
pronounced Miss Waller solemnly.
She looked meaningly at May, who
stood near, looking her best in
pale blue, with a big white hat, but her niece
pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>A week had elapsed since Mrs. Burnside's
visit to the Inglis girls; and it was again
Saturday afternoon. It had been a week of
absolutely tropical heat, exhausting to a
degree; and Mr. Lang, noticing May's pale
cheeks, had proposed a trip up the river
in his steam-launch. So, with their mutual
friends the Wingates, and some other people,
they were now bound for an island some
distance above Kingston, where they intended
to land and have tea.</p>

<p>After the scorching and crowded streets,
the river, with its green, tree-shaded banks,
was indeed a pleasant change; and, had she
been free from care, May would have greatly
enjoyed watching the numerous gay boats
and launches filled with happy holiday-makers.
But the presence of Mr. Lang&mdash;vulgar, fussy,
and pretentious&mdash;spoiled everything, and she
avoided him as much as possible, greatly
to her aunt's disgust.</p>

<p>The island at which they presently arrived
was very small; and so crowded with people
that at another time the scene would have
amused May. They landed with some difficulty,
amid the crowd of skiffs, punts, and
canoes, which were moored to the banks; and
had to walk warily, not to tread upon their
late occupants, who were now grouped round
every variety of tea equipage, arrayed in every
kind of costume. One or two people, ostentatious
like themselves, were attended by
liveried servants to turn the whole thing
into a burlesque; but the great mass had
spread their tea with their own hands, and
it was comical to see how their ideas of a
picnic varied. Here would be a homely meal
with thick enamelled tea-things, huge chunks
of bread-and-butter, and shrimps or watercress
for a relish. Next door would be an aristocratic
party with a silver teapot, fairy-like
china, expensive cakes, and fruit on artistic
dessert plates. Here a stout materfamilias,
purple with the heat, struggled to satisfy
her hungry brood of eight with hastily buttered
rolls; there a pair of lovers, oblivious
of all else, sat partaking of nectar and ambrosia,
in imagination a thousand miles away.
Everywhere was good humour, laughter, and
happiness.</p>

<p>At last, after his usual bustle, Mr. Lang
contrived to secure a vacant spot for his party;
though not without an angry argument with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
some plainly dressed people who, with scant
respect for African millionaires, declined to
move their common delft tea-service to make
way for his costly Dresden. Whilst the footman
spread the cloth May sat abstractedly
gazing over the sunlit river, when suddenly
she caught a glimpse in an approaching
boat of a figure which made her heart leap.
Surely that stalwart young man in flannels,
rowing two girls towards the island, was
Harold Inglis! With consummate skill he
steered his cockleshell craft to the bank, then
helped his sisters out, and, carrying a basket,
came to find a place to sit down.</p>

<p>"What a handsome girl!" murmured more
than one of Mr. Lang's party
as Esther advanced with her
queenly gait. May, delighted,
rose to greet her. "How
wonderful to meet you
here!" exclaimed Miss Inglis.
"Harold had to come up to
town on business, and we persuaded
him to bring us up
the river."</p>

<p>"So glad to see you again,
Mrs. Burnside," said the
young doctor as they shook
hands; his honest English
face flushing as his glance
met hers. That glance and
that handclasp seemed to
throw a flood of light upon
the secret places of May's
soul; for suddenly she realised
that she loved him better
than her life. He was, and
always must be, the one man
in the world to her.</p>

<p>Miss Waller was not pleased
at this addition to their
party; but she could not
interfere when Mr. Lang
pressed the Inglises to join
the circle assembled at tea.
Nor could they well refuse:
though independent Esther
insisted on making use of
the provisions they had
brought with them. Harold
stationed himself beside May,
as a matter of course, and
contrived, under cover of the
lively chatter of the rest, to
tell her about the new
patients he had secured at
Beachbourne, and hear what
she had been doing in London. It was a
very harmless, matter-of-fact conversation,
but it drew down many jealous glances from
Mr. Lang, which May perceived, but did not
heed. Why should she not enjoy this brief
moment of happiness?</p>

<p>"Shall I see you again before I leave? I'm
going back on Monday," Harold observed
wistfully, when the tea-things had been
packed up for the return journey.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus034.jpg" width="350" height="488" alt="ever" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"If he ever comes again!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>But she shook her head, knowing it was
useless to invite him to call upon her aunt;
nor could she promise to visit Windermere
Mansions. "We shall be returning the end
of next week, I hope," she answered hurriedly,
sorry to seem so inhospitable. "I shall be
so glad to leave London!"</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Burnside," interrupted Mr. Lang,
bustling up, "your aunt's invited me to dine
with you at eight; and if I'm to be back in
time to dress, we must look sharp. Sorry to
have to say good-bye to you, Miss Inglis," he
added, turning to stately Esther with his most
patronising air. "I wish I could ask you to
come back in the launch with us; but there's
so little room."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I prefer a rowing-boat. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
thoroughly disapprove of steam launches on
a crowded river like the Thames," calmly
responded she; whilst Miss Waller gasped,
open-mouthed, at such effrontery. Imagine
a beggarly girl in an office daring to address
such criticism to the great Mr. Lang!</p>

<p>The lovers had perforce to separate, for the
rowing-boat would, of course, be soon left
behind by the launch. May took her seat
with a sinking heart at the prospect of Mr.
Lang's company for the rest of the day; and
Harold was so silent all the way home that
Esther commented on it as they disembarked.</p>

<p>"So this is the end of my little treat in
honour of my rise of salary!" she ruefully
remarked. "I thought it would be pleasant
on the river; but I feel almost sorry we
came. Certainly, Mrs. Poyser was right in
her opinion of 'pleasuring-days.'"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3><em>Reprieved.</em></h3>


<p>"Now, May," began Miss Waller in her
most portentous tone, on Monday
morning, "I must have an explanation
with you. I'm going
home this week, for it's ruinously expensive
being here; and to-day Mr. Lang is coming
for his answer. Without any beating about
the bush, I expect you to marry him."</p>

<p>"Oh, aunt, don't&mdash;<em>don't</em>!" entreated May,
wringing her hands. "I cannot marry Mr.
Lang."</p>

<p>"What childish nonsense! Fancy refusing
a house in Palace Gardens, and all that
money!"</p>

<p>"I can't and won't marry him."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, you and Doris must
find another home. I have pinched myself
to keep you in luxury; but if you will be
so wickedly blind to your plain duty, I wash
my hands of you."</p>

<p>"I don't care one bit for myself, aunt; I
could earn a living, I'm sure, and I'd gladly
do it. Let me try," pleaded May, "I will
promise never to cost you another penny,
if you will only be so kind as to give Doris
a home until I am able to keep her myself."</p>

<p>"Which will not be till Doomsday. Talk
of earning your living&mdash;what rubbish! Why,
you haven't even one decent accomplishment.
No, if you leave my house, Doris
goes, too; I won't have the little spoilt
monkey left on my hands."</p>

<p>"But, aunt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides, think what advantages you could
give Doris if you married Mr. Lang&mdash;the
best possible education, horses, carriages,
Continental trips, everything! If you really
cared at all for your child, you couldn't
hesitate for a minute."</p>

<p>It was a clever argument, and it made
May waver as nothing else could; and Miss
Waller did not know whether to be glad
or sorry that just then Mr. Lang himself
was announced.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Miss Waller," he began, as the
spinster, after a few casual observations, was
about to leave the room. "I've nothing to
say to Mrs. Burnside you may not hear as
well. Your niece knows by this time that
I am anxious to have her for my wife. I
want to marry and settle down now, and
I can promise you," he added, turning to
face May for the first time, "a most
luxurious home&mdash;you've seen it&mdash;both for
yourself and your little girl. Your aunt
wishes it, I know; and I hope, Mrs. Burnside&mdash;May&mdash;you'll
make me very happy by
saying you'll be my wife before Christmas."</p>

<p>He came closer, and would have taken her
hand; but she started back. Her aunt's
basilisk eyes were fixed on her, to add to
her discomfiture; but she said as firmly as
she could, "I am very grateful for your
kindness, Mr. Lang; nevertheless, I must
refuse your offer, for I do not love you,
and I could not marry any man unless I
did."</p>

<p>"Now, really, Miss Waller," remonstrated
the plutocrat, turning with an injured air
to the wrathful spinster, "I call this too
bad! It was understood between us that
you would prepare Mrs. Burnside, so that
it might all be plain sailing. I'm not accustomed
to ask and be refused, I can tell
you."</p>

<p>"May must have lost her senses to reject
such an offer, Mr. Lang," returned Miss
Waller, with an annihilating glance at her
niece. "She is an ungrateful, undutiful girl;
and if she refuses you, I will have nothing
more to do with her."</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined Mr. Lang, with a gulp,
as if swallowing something very nauseous
to the taste, "I must confess I didn't expect
to be sent to the right-about like this.
However, young ladies often change their
minds; and perhaps, when Mrs. Burnside
thinks my offer quietly over, she may alter
her opinion. I've great faith in your persuasions,
Miss Waller. I've just had a telegram,
saying a fall of rock has damaged
the machinery at the Springkloof, and I'm
wanted out there, so I must sail for the
Cape at once. I expect to be away some
months; by November I shall probably
be back in England. I give Mrs. Burnside
until then to consider my offer; I won't
look upon this as a final rejection. I'm sure,
when she thinks of all I'm in a position to
offer, she can't be so foolish as to refuse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>"How kind&mdash;how generous!" exclaimed
Miss Waller, as May stood in stony silence.
"I promise in my niece's name that when
you come back she will accept you. I hope
we shall see you again before you leave?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, for I've a lot to do before I
go. But I'll write to you; and as soon as I
possibly can I shall return for Mrs. Burnside's
answer."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus036.jpg" width="450" height="373" alt="wondeful" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"How wonderful to meet you here!"&mdash;<em>p. 513.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>As if in a sick dream, with this threat
ringing in her ears, May mechanically
tendered him her limp hand in farewell.
When they were once more alone her aunt
said in crisp, dry tones:</p>

<p>"I shall return to Beachbourne on Wednesday,
and make arrangements for spending
August and September in visiting amongst
our friends in the country. We have plenty
of invitations. I have said all I need say on
the subject of Mr. Lang. Meanwhile, you
can choose between Palace Gardens and
every luxury, and a life of starvation and
beggary for you and Doris."</p>

<p>Despite the apparent calm with which
Mr. Lang had taken May's rejection of his
flattering offer, he was nevertheless in a very
bad temper when he left the house and
jumped into his victoria. He was not accustomed
to rebuffs&mdash;which made the fact that he
had just been rejected by a penniless widow,
only saved from actual want by her aunt's
charity, doubly galling.</p>

<p>"I'm mad to care so much about a
pale-faced girl with nothing to say for
herself; and I really ought to do better.
I could easily marry a lady of title, or
anybody I choose; and it would serve her
right if I went straight off and proposed to
somebody else, just to show her that rich
husbands don't grow on every bush!"</p>

<p>Revenge is always the first thought of a
mean mind which is smarting from a sense
of injury. Mr. Lang chuckled over this idea
for some time, and the result was, that when
Esther Inglis entered their one sitting-room
about half-past five that day, she found Mr.
Lang seated in the most comfortable chair,
awaiting her.</p>

<p>She instantly assumed her thorny manner;
but it had no more effect than it would have
had upon a rhinoceros. "I've come to say
good-bye for the present, Miss Inglis," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
airily remarked, as if his visit were a matter
of course. "I leave to-morrow for Johannesburg
on business; and as I shall probably
see your brother, it would give me great
pleasure to take charge of anything you
may wish to send him."</p>

<p>Esther's handsome face relaxed. Really it
was very kind and thoughtful of Mr. Lang,
who, with his influence, might prove a
valuable friend to Jack.</p>

<p>"It is very good of you, and in his last
letter Jack asked us to send him some
collars and ties; they are such a fearful
price at Johannesburg, and not good. But
they are not bought yet, and you say you
leave to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the shops will not be closed for
some time, and my victoria is at the door,
if you will honour me by using it to go
where you wish."</p>

<p>Esther hesitated a moment; but the opportunity
of saving expensive and troublesome
postage, besides serving Jack, was too good
to lose. Mr. Lang rose, and indicated a box
lying on the table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus037.jpg" width="350" height="404" alt="thanks" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Oh, don't thank me."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I've brought you a little fruit, Miss Inglis,
just sent to me from my country place near
Dorking. My head-gardener prides himself
on his peaches and nectarines; but I must
leave you to judge."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" cried Esther, with sparkling
eyes; for she had not tasted a nectarine
since leaving Mallowfleld. In a moment she
had undone the satin ribbon which tied
down the lid, and was feasting her eyes on
such peaches as she had seldom seen.</p>

<p>"As you seem fond of fruit, I'll give orders
to my gardener to send you a box periodically,"
observed Mr. Lang. "Oh, don't thank
me; I shall be away, and somebody may as
well enjoy it. And if you'll have the parcel
and letters ready, my footman shall call for
them to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>He accompanied Esther down to the street,
where his beautifully appointed carriage was
waiting; and it must be confessed she enjoyed
finding herself seated
behind a spruce coachman
and footman once
more. "You will take
this lady's orders," pompously
commanded Mr.
Lang. "Keep the carriage
as long as you like,
Miss Inglis, and I'll not
forget about the parcel."</p>

<p>So manifest was his
desire to propitiate, that
Esther could do no less
than bid him a civil farewell,
with the hope that
he might have a pleasant
journey. Then she rolled
away, looking so much
at home in the smart
carriage that Mr. Lang
gazed after her admiringly.</p>

<p>"By Jove, how well
she sets the whole thing
off! Looks like a lady
used to carriages all
her life. May Burnside
really isn't a patch upon
Esther Inglis; there
is no mistake about
that!"</p>

<p>Had Miss Waller only
been there to hear him,
she might well have
trembled for the success
of her darling scheme of
marrying May to a rich
man.</p>

<h2>EASTER EGG ROLLING IN WASHINGTON</h2>

<p class="cap_1">"Going to Mr. President's!"</p>
</div>

<p>That is what
the hundreds of
little boys and
girls will tell
you any Easter
Monday morning,
should you
chance to stop
them and ask
their destination
as they go
toddling along
the streets of
Washington
with baskets of
eggs hanging on
their arms and a glad delight shining in
their eyes.</p>

<p>They make up a very "mixed" crowd,
these children! There is the dainty little
miss in richly embroidered frock and
wide silk sash, with one tiny hand
held tightly in the grasp of a big negro
nurse and the other hand clasping
lovingly a basket of pretty coloured
eggs; there is another little girl in a
very clean but much-faded gingham or
print apron, trotting along at her
mother's side&mdash;the mother dressed, perchance,
in shabby black, belonging to
the class known in the Southern part
of the States as the "poor whites";
there is also the trio of little "darkey"
girls, dancing merrily along the sidewalk,
swinging their egg-baskets as
though with intention of spilling the
eggs over passers-by, yet never quite
dropping them, and singing the while
as they keep step&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Tra la la la, tra la la la,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Easter Monday morning!"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>There are nice, smart-looking little
boys, strutting along proudly in their
first pair of knickerbockers, with pockets
bulging out with Easter eggs, their
black nurses walking just a few steps
behind them; there are the poor white
boys whose clothes are patched and
boots worn with toes protruding. On
other days they sell newspapers, black
boots, and do "odd jobbs" to earn a
few cents, but on Easter Monday morning
they somehow get together a collection
of coloured eggs and go to see the President.
Then there are the little black
boys, some smartly dressed (for many
of the coloured people of Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
are well-to-do), and others as shabby
as shabby can be. But no matter.
Are they not provided with Easter
Monday eggs and going up to the
White House to see "Mr. President,"
who every Easter Monday gives over his
beautiful lawn to as many little boys
and girls as like to go and see him, and
roll their eggs over the grassy slopes
that look out over the Potomac River?</p>

<p class="center">THE INVASION OF THE PRESIDENT'S LAWN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On no other day during the year
does Washington present so interesting
and picturesque an appearance as on
Easter Monday, and it is the happiest
day of all the year with the children of
the Capitol City. In England, of course,
Easter Monday is always a Bank Holiday,
but not so in the United States. In New
York and other large American cities
banks and shops and schools are open as
usual; but in the district of Columbia,
where Washington is situated, it is a legal
holiday. That in itself makes it a happy
time for the children. Then, add to the
joy of having no lessons to learn the
fact that they are allowed to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
dozens of coloured eggs to the White
House lawn and play the games of
"egg-picking" and "egg-rolling" as the
specially invited guests of the President
of the United States, and it will be
easily understood how festive an occasion
is Easter Monday to the children of
Washington.</p>

<p>Not even the oldest inhabitants of
Washington can remember the time
when the boys and girls of the city did
not celebrate Easter Monday by "egg-rolling,"
although the children of fifty
years ago rolled their eggs down Capitol
Hill, under the shadow of the magnificent
Capitol building, instead of on the
White House lawn. Year after year the
children of former generations trudged
up the great hill with their egg-baskets
over their arms and had the happiest
times imaginable with their Easter
games.</p>

<p>One Easter Monday, however, about
twenty years ago, hundreds of boys and
girls went to Capitol Hill with their eggs
just as they had done in previous years,
when they were astonished to be hustled
off the grounds by special messengers
and policemen from the Senate and
House of Representatives, who declared
that the distinguished Senators and Congressmen
in convention assembled had
made up their minds that their "door-yard"
was no longer to be disfigured
for days after Easter Monday with
broken eggs and vari-coloured shells!
They were weary of having their highly
polished boots smeared with yolks of
eggs, and Easter Monday "egg-rolling"
in Washington was to be ended!</p>

<p>Then there went up all about the
precincts of the nation's Capitol a loud
wail of anguish and wrath from hundreds
of childish throats, in which the numerous
nurses and attendants joined. Many
boys and girls gathered on the steps
of the building, sobbing in disappointment,
some of the larger boys throwing
out direful hints of vengeance to
be wreaked on the heads of the nation's
law-makers; but the stately Senators
remained stony-hearted, in spite of it
all. In the midst of the tearful hubbub
the President's carriage drove past,
and President Hayes (the then head of
the nation) drew up near the portico
to inquire why the children wept instead
of rolling their eggs on Easter
Monday.</p>

<p>A chorus of voices informed him that
the "nasty Senators wouldn't let them
play any more because they messed up
the grounds"; and then again from the
throng of little ones confronting the
President there arose fresh outbursts
of grief and indignation.</p>

</div>

<p>"Never you mind, children," said
President Hayes soothingly. "You may
come right up to my house and play
in my back yard."</p>

<p>Then the mourning was turned to
rejoicing. Every child knew that in
all the city of Washington there was
not so wonderful a "back yard" as
that which belonged to the White
House. Its beautifully kept slopes were
ideal places for "egg-rolling," and then
there was the great fountain in the
middle of the lawn! So when the
President's carriage started to return
to the White House, it was followed
by several hundred boys and girls
swinging their egg-baskets, and singing
and shouting out their gratitude to the
President of the United States, who
was going to let them play in his
garden. I doubt if ever an American
President had an escort of which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
had such cause to feel proud as that
which accompanied President Hayes to
the White House gates on that memorable
Easter Monday.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<div class="caption">
<p>Lester Ralph.</p>
<p class="center">ON THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Outside the gates they were kept
waiting for about an hour, while the
President gave his hurried instructions
to the gardeners to put the place in
readiness. At eleven o'clock the gates
swung open, and from that time till
six o'clock the children rolled their
eggs.</p>

<p>Ever since then Washington children
have gone regularly every Easter Monday
to play in the President's "back
yard," each of President Hayes's successors
having kept up the custom of
inserting in the Washington papers
each year an invitation to all the
children residents of the town to spend
the day rolling eggs on the lawn.</p>

<p>In President Hayes's time his own
children joined in the sport, and during
the last term of President Cleveland
the President's little girls, who were
considered too young to roll eggs with
the elder children, were kept on the
back portico with their mother or their
nurse, where they could watch the progress
of the games.</p>

<p>Two years ago, on Easter Monday,
I spent the day on the White House
lawn, watching the big "Presidential
children's party," as it is called. The
gates were opened at a little after ten
o'clock, and during the day there were
several thousand children playing in
the grounds. Many of the children,
besides carrying their baskets of eggs,
carried also their luncheon-baskets,
and when tired of games they sat
about on the grass, picnic-fashion, eating
bread-and-butter and cakes and
hard-boiled eggs. I should here mention
that, although the President does not
consider it necessary to make any rules
for the preservation of order among
his young guests&mdash;it being taken for
granted that all children invited to the
President's garden will behave in their
very best style&mdash;he always requests
that those who accept his invitation
to roll their eggs on his lawn will
be particular to bring with them
only eggs that are thoroughly hard
boiled, for in the game of "egg-picking"
the use of raw or soft-boiled eggs
would be, to say the least, most inconvenient!</p>

<p>The game of "egg-picking" is a very
simple one, although it is entered into
most enthusiastically by the boys and
girls. The children separate themselves
into groups of eight or ten, then seat
themselves on the grass at the top of
the slopes and roll their eggs down to the
bottom. The eggs that make the descent
without getting cracked or "picked"
may be brought back and re-rolled, until
they do get cracked or until the game
is over, while those that get "picked"
are placed back in the baskets. The
boy who can hit his neighbour's egg and
"pick" it without "picking" his own
is looked upon as something of a hero.
Of course, toward the end of the game
many of the players drop out, all of their
eggs having got "picked." Very often the
players are reduced to two who show
themselves particularly expert, and then
there is great excitement watching for
the winner.</p>

<p>Besides the game of "egg-picking"
there are egg-ball games, egg croquet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
games; but plain "egg-rolling," which
consists of rolling eggs down the slopes,
going after them, and rolling them again
and again, seems to be the favourite
amusement. Then, too, the children engage
in "jumping the rope" and other
similar amusements.</p>

<p>Although many of the children spend
the entire day on the lawn, numbers of
them remain for a couple of hours only.
By this means the grounds are not kept
so crowded as they would otherwise be.
The hours between three and five o'clock,
however, are considered the most enjoyable,
as during that time the President
always arranges to have the Marine
Baud to entertain the children with music,
and it is at that time also that the
President makes his appearance out on
the back portico to greet the children.
It is, of course, thoroughly understood
that so busy a man as
the President cannot
spend his whole day
with his young visitors.
He entertains them
by turning over his
grounds to them, and
they enjoy themselves
in their own way without
molestation.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the
Easter Monday which I
spent in Washington
President McKinley came
out on the portico at
about half-past three.
He took off his hat and
waved it to the children,
who all gathered as near
as possible about the
portico and shouted
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Howdy do, Mr. President?
Howdy do, howdy
do?"&mdash;the boys taking
off their caps and the
little girls waving their
handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"How do you do,
children? Glad to see
you, and hope you are
having a good time!"
shouted back the President.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<div class="caption">
<p>Lester Ralph.</p>
<p class="center">PRESIDENT McKINLEY GREETING HIS YOUNG VISITORS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Splendid time, Mr. President, and
thank you for your invitation," called
back the delighted little guests.</p>

<p>"That's right!" returned the President,
laughing. "I hope you'll all come again
next Easter Monday."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. President. Good-bye,
good-bye!" shouted the children. Then
President McKinley went back to his
duties of State and the children returned
to their egg-rolling. Mrs. McKinley sat
on the portico most of the afternoon
watching the merriment. Occasionally
a little boy or girl would edge up to the
portico, and push a blue or red egg through
the railings, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please, Mrs. President, I've brought
you one of my eggs to keep!"</p>

<p>Mrs. McKinley accepted the little presents
with the sweetest of smiles and a
"Thank you."</p>

<p>At about two o'clock in the afternoon
the White House lawn looked like a large
picnic ground. Some of the children had
brought napkins to lay upon the grass
when they should be ready to eat their
luncheon, and on the napkins they spread
their boiled eggs and bread-and-butter.
One little girl, when I complimented her
on her daintiness, explained:</p>

<p>"I does it so I won't get eggshells on
Mr. President's grass! My mamma told
me I must be careful, cos it wouldn't be
very nice if the President of the 'Nited
States had to go round to-morrow picking
up eggshells after me!"</p>

<p>During the afternoon there were several
slight accidents at the fountain. Some
of the children delighted in digging all
the meat from their eggs through the
smallest possible aperture and then floating
the empty shells in the lower basin
of the fountain where the water was undisturbed.
In trying to keep their
improvised ships from sailing away, two
little girls fell into the water, but they
were quickly rescued by their nurses and
taken home to be dried.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the crowd began to
disperse, and at a little past six the
small guests of the President had all left
the lawn and were on their way to their
various homes. Such a variety of homes,
indeed, they went to! Some to magnificent
mansions on Connecticut Avenue.
Their fathers were high Government
officials, Senators, members of the Cabinet,
and their mothers well-known society
women. Other little boys and girls went
to very humble homes and minded their
little baby brothers and sisters while
their mothers got supper; and then there
were the homes in the localities given
over almost entirely to the negro population.
Before the War their parents and
grandparents had been slaves, little
dreaming that their descendants would
ever be invited along with the children
of the aristocratic whites to play in the
President's "back yard"!</p>

<p>By the way, what a sight that "back
yard" did present on the morning following
Easter Monday! There were four
gardeners busily at work with rakes and
brooms and baskets. They were gathering
up the litter of eggshells, breadcrumbs,
bits of paper, lost playthings,
and tiny bits of muslin and calico that
had somehow got torn off the dresses of
some of the children. At the fountain
one of the gardeners was fishing out pieces
of string and floating shells. It was
four o'clock when the garden was finally
"picked up" and shorn of its festive appearance.
It was then absolutely "spick and
span," and no one could ever have guessed
that the day before it had been a playground
for several thousand children!</p>

of the London Rifle Brigade. When on the way to the Rainham Rifle Range some time ago, Banks
and several of his companions were attracted to this spot by the cries of some bystanders, who stated
that a child had fallen into the thick muddy water of the tidal creek and had disappeared. Banks
immediately threw off his coat, plunged into the filthy water, and after a three minutes' search succeeded
in finding the boy. Unhappily, the child was past help; but, all the same, the gallantry displayed
by the rescuer was rewarded by the bestowal of the Bronze Medal of <span class="smcap">The Quiver</span> Heroes' Fund.</p></div>

<h2>MISS LUCRETIA'S NEW IDEA.</h2>



<h3><em>A COMPLETE STORY.</em></h3>

<p class="center">By M. H. Cornwall Legh, Author of
"The Steep Ascent," Etc.</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

 <div class="drop">
 <img src="images/illus045a.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="109" class="cap" />
 <p class="cap_1">"So poor Annie is dead!" Miss
Lucretia repeated as she
laid down the black-edged
letter which she had just
read through for the third
time and wiped her eyes
with a handkerchief already
damp and flabby. "Poor Annie! So soon
after poor Edward's death too! And now
I wonder what will become of poor little
Amy?"</p>
</div>

<p>She repeated the adjective which seemed
most appropriate as often as she liked, for
she was only speaking to herself.</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia lived alone in a very small
house, which was one of a row, all just
alike, with a bow-window apiece for their
glory, and a little bit of garden and a fence
and a gate. They were called Primrose
Cottages, despite the fact that there
were no primroses about them.</p>

<p>Thirlambury was a very dull, behind-the-age
little town, and people thought
Miss Lucretia a very dull, behind-the-age
little lady. She thought so herself; for
she had always taken life meekly.</p>

<p>Lucretia was the only one of the three
sisters&mdash;of whose happy girlhood together
the old maid was thinking as she wiped
away her tears&mdash;who had been at all meek.
Constantia and Ann had both been strong-charactered,
masterful girls, in accordance
with the traditions of their family. With
Constantia this decided turn had met
with the happiest development. It had
enabled her to manage to perfection a
husband and family, and it was with
pardonable pride that she now looked
at her six successful sons and daughters,
all brought up just as they should
have been, physically, intellectually, and
morally; of whom the last had just
left the nursery for the school-room.</p>

<p>With Ann the family characteristics had
gone in the wrong direction. Her strong
will had led her to marry a very unsatisfactory
little man, whom his family finally
exported to New Zealand, with her and
their four children, rejoicing over the
happy riddance. Out there Constantia
did not like to say, providentially, though
that was the adverb which suggested
itself&mdash;the four children took diphtheria,
and every one of them died.</p>

<p>When the grass had grown green on
those four graves, another child was born&mdash;little
Amy&mdash;and Aunt Lucretia was asked
to be its godmother. And now, there was
this child of five years old left without
either parent. They had not been first-class
parents, but Miss Lucretia did not
think of that; her heart being of too old-fashioned
make for such philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>"An orphan, poor little dear!" she said
to herself, and her handkerchief became
damp again at the thought.</p>

<p>"Constantia has arranged already about
her being brought to England," Miss Lucretia
soliloquised. (Being alone, she had
got into the way of soliloquising.) "How
prompt Constantia always is! And now
what will become of the child?"</p>

<p>It was not an idle speculation. Miss
Lucretia was revolving something in her
mind&mdash;an idea so new, so absorbing, that
over it her eyes dried, and she put back
the letter into its envelope with untrembling
fingers.</p>

<p>"I am sure I could do it!" she said at
last, speaking aloud this time, and with a
great deal of determination. "A child of
five cannot cost much to keep, and there
are many little ways in which I could
reduce my expenditure." Then she relapsed
into silent thought again. She was
making deep calculations, wondering how
an income which just sufficed for her and
her faithful Fanny could be stretched at
the four corners so as to cover the expenses
of one more member of humanity. Such a
little member that in a large household
she could be received and fed and clothed
for some years to come without any perceptible
difference in the outgoings; but
this was a very small household, and the
matter had to be considered.</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia's income was of the kind
described as modest; but she was a careful
manager, and, as everybody knew how
poor she was, nothing was expected of her
in the way of entertaining beyond a quiet
cup of afternoon tea, and the promoters
of charity lists went away from her door
contented if she only gave half-a-crown.</p>

<p>She always did give the half-crown, and
a penny to the organ-grinder who came
round weekly, and sixpence each to the
butcher's boy, the baker's boy, and the
grocer's boy at Christmas; the same
every year, not allowing herself any wild
excursions of charity till the regular
subscriptions had been provided for.</p>

<p>But it was not in her philanthropies that
Miss Lucretia proposed making her substantial
reductions. There were a great
many little luxuries which could be curtailed.</p>

<p>Regarding food, people would have
said that no one was more economical
than Miss Lucretia, but Miss
Lucretia herself knew better. It was
true that there never was any waste
in this little establishment. A pound
of meat was never ordered when three-quarters
of a pound would do; and every
scrap of food was eaten. But the meat
and the milk and the butter ordered
for 4, Primrose Cottages were always of
the very best. The eggs must be newlaid,
and not selected. The pot of jam&mdash;"preserves,"
Miss Lucretia called it, with
old-fashioned elegance&mdash;in which she and
Fanny indulged once a fortnight, must
be of whole fruit in syrup; not the
marvels of cheapness in two-pound jars.</p>

<p>"Why," thought Miss Lucretia now
to herself, "should I buy butter at
eighteenpence a pound, when they say
the Normandy butter, or the Brittany,
is really excellent? And it does seem
a sinful waste to give two shillings for
tea when one can get it quite good,
the Vicar's wife tells me, at sixteen-pence.
Indeed, I have seen phenomenal
tea at a shilling." And so on.</p>

<p>The little lady proceeded with her
reductions till she was quite convinced
that Amy's coming need make no real
difference in Fanny's comfort&mdash;the
question which had pressed most upon
her mind.</p>

<p>Then there were Amy's clothes to be
thought of. Well, they would not cost
much. There was a gown hanging up
now in the cupboard which might be
cut up for her.</p>

<p>Then there was a crimson merino dress
which Miss Lucretia had bought last
summer for the Vicarage garden-party&mdash;not
without some misgivings as to the
choice of so unwearing a colour, but
with the solace to her conscience of
knowing it could be dyed.</p>

<p>That would make a sweet little frock
and cloak for Amy; for the dress had
only been worn twice, and its wearer
had held it up very carefully out of the
dust.</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia went up to the little
box-room opening out of her bedroom,
and turned out a number of old treasures&mdash;things
she had kept ever since
her girlhood, carefully folded, wrong
side out, and covered with tissue-paper.
Here was her bridesmaid's dress for
Constantia's wedding&mdash;that would cut up
into a lovely Sunday frock; and here
was a piece of china silk which had
never been made up till Miss Lucretia
grew too old for white dresses; and
other things that would all come in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
Yes, she would have no difficulty in
dressing little Amy, and making her
look just as smart as the children at
Beaconsfield Mansion when occasion arose
for it. She hoped the occasions would
arise, that her child would be asked to
parties, like other children, and with
a new interest the old woman thought
of the different families of her acquaintance.</p>

<p>And now about a room for Amy. The
little box-room must be cleared out, and
that would make a charming nest for
her. The old chintz with the rosebuds
on it Miss Lucretia had just taken from
its paper would be the very thing for
curtains. A little bed would just fit
here behind the door, and a washstand
there, and so on. Miss Lucretia planned
it all out with absorbing interest. The
question was, where was the money to
come from for buying the furniture?
There were certain things in the box-room
which could be sold. Miss Lucretia's
harp; she never played on it now, and
harping was out of fashion, so it would
not be wanted for Amy. And that portfolio
of engravings&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash; She had
soon marked out enough of her treasures
to make the furnishing of the little room
an easy matter.</p>

<p>Then she went downstairs and divulged
her great project to Fanny. Her co-operation
was very necessary, and her
mistress approached her a little timidly.</p>

<p>"Fanny, I am thinking of having a
child to live with me."</p>

<p>"Bless us! ma'am, a child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my poor sister's little orphan."</p>

<p>Fanny's heart was warm. She listened
to Miss Lucretia's plans and wishes without
any crushing comment, but at the
end she remarked, "Well, I should have
thought as Mrs. Dalrymple would have
taken her; she is so rich and with
that big place and all; but if she
don't feel disposed that way, and you
do, ma'am, well, I suppose the poor little
soul had best come to us." That was
quite enough, and now Miss Lucretia
hurried out of the house, and into the
High Street, to inquire about the price
of children's beds. It was early in the
day, of course, to enter into such details,
but then, the whole affair was so interesting
that they could not be put off till
to-morrow.</p>

<p>As Miss Lucretia walked down the
High Street, she was attracted by a toyshop,
and found herself straying into it
to inquire the price of a doll in the
window. It would be very silly to buy
one so soon, and before any of the
necessaries of life were provided for.
But the temptation proved too strong
for her. She went in and bought it&mdash;the
first present she would give to <em>her
child</em>.</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia spent an hour in the furniture
shop. She had to arrange first with
the proprietor about the sale of her own
belongings, and then to choose the furniture
for the room. She found she wanted
only the prettiest, nicest things for Amy,
though the cheapest for their solid value
would have been her main object if for
herself. Then there was a lovely paper,
with nursery rhyme pictures all over it,
which so fascinated her that she ordered
half-a-dozen pieces of it to come on approval.</p>

<p>Altogether, it was a most exciting afternoon,
and Miss Lucretia came home with a
springing step, and radiant eyes, and a
general bearing of youthfulness, such as
she had not known for the last twenty
years. A bright golden glow had suddenly
overspread the grey landscape of her life,
such as the sun sometimes throws at sunset,
when it looks out from under a cloud
at the end of a long grey day.</p>

<p>Before the post went out, she wrote a
letter to Constantia, announcing her intention
of taking Amy for her own, which
gave a delightful seal of finality to her
decision.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>"I could not have believed that
Lucretia would be so foolish. Just
fancy! she wants to adopt Amy!"
was Mrs. Dalrymple's comment, as
she read her sister's letter; and everyone
at the breakfast table exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It is a very generous idea," remarked
Mr. Dalrymple mildly. He had always
been a mild sort of man, and marriage
with Constantia had not made him less so.</p>

<p>"Generous! yes. Lucretia is always
generous. You know the difficulty I had
in stopping her giving expensive presents
to the children; but it is so very foolish.
I shall write her a letter, of course, and tell
her that we intend to have Amy ourselves.
Poor Lucretia! Fancy her with the charge
of a child!"</p>

<p>So Constantia wrote her letter. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
contained about a quarter of the words
that Lucretia had used, and was very
sensible, kind and decided. There was
no answer required to it.</p>

<p>Great was Mrs. Dalrymple's surprise,
therefore, when by return of post came a
reply, not of acquiescence, but setting
forth the other aunt's superior claim as
godmother, an idea which, as Constantia
remarked, was simply absurd.</p>

<p>"I shall have to go to Thirlambury myself,"
she said: "though it is not very convenient."
It was often not very convenient
to go to Thirlambury.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the meantime, Miss Lucretia had been
indulging in her new day-dream, till every
bit of her life had been remodelled in anticipation,
and brought into harmony with
her coming work and responsibility as an
adopted mother. Already she attached to
herself that beautiful title, the missing of
which had been the sole sorrow of her life.
As a young girl, Lucretia's day-dreams
had not been of lovers, but of marriage;
the joys of children clinging round her
neck, the merry voices about the house,
the little feet pattering up and down.</p>

<p>And now she counted the days to the
one coming so near, when she should feel
the real warm arms of little Amy clasped
round "godmamma's" neck, and fold the
child in her own with the new wonderful
joy of possession. She felt that she could
hold up her head again among women, and
that the life which a week ago had seemed
to hold nothing more except advancing infirmities
was full of new possibilities and
ever-increasing interest. Miss Lucretia
lived again.</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia actually bought the bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
which the shopman had urged her to purchase
at once, or it might be gone, as he
had no other bedstead for a child.</p>

<p>As Miss Lucretia relinquished one after
another of her own comforts and conveniences,
the blessedness of giving grew
more and more apparent to her. Nothing
in life had ever given her a joy like the
joy of this sacrifice.</p>

<p>Four days had passed so, and Miss
Lucretia was just planning which plot
of the small garden space allowed to a
Primrose cottage might be spared from
beans and cauliflowers to make a flowerbed
for Amy, when a ring was heard at
the door-bell. Miss Lucretia answered
it herself, as Fanny was out, and there
stood Constantia!</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus049.jpg" width="250" height="515" alt="Constancia" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">There stood Constantia!</p></div>
</div>

<p>Miss Lucretia was always delighted to
see her sister, and made the most of her
rather infrequent visits. But to-day a
kind of misgiving came over her at the
unexpected sight of Constantia's smiling
face; and a sensation of defeat as Constantia
uttered, in her brisk, cheerful
voice, the words, "And how are you,
Lucretia? You didn't expect to see me?"</p>

<p>Lucretia welcomed her, as usual, and
took her into the little parlour, which
was drawing-room or dining-room according
to the time of day. It was drawing-room
now, and the dining-table stood
folded, with a cloth and some ornaments
on it, in a corner; everything was as
neat and carefully arranged as it always
was; each chair in that particular spot
which experience had proved to be the
best for it.</p>

<p>"How nice and tidy you always look,
Lucretia," was Mrs. Dalrymple's first
remark, as she sat down with a genial
laugh in the visitor's arm-chair. "You
must be struck with the difference when
you come to The Towers. With six
children, it is impossible to keep everything
in its place!"</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia asked after the six
children, categorically, staving off the
subject which she knew very well had
brought her sister to Thirlambury.</p>

<p>"The girls are as well as possible,"
answered their mother, massing them,
for brevity; "and they are all looking
forward so much to having Amy." Mrs.
Dalrymple was a person who took bulls
by their horns. She always knew exactly
what she intended to do with the bull&mdash;the
great secret of success in life&mdash;and
was quite sure about its being the best
thing that could be done.</p>

<p>"But I intended to have Amy,"
answered Miss Lucretia, in almost as
firm a voice, but putting herself at a disadvantage
at once by her slip of the past
tense.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you did. You wrote me
all about it. It was exceedingly kind
and good of you to think of such a thing,
but, of course, it was quite out of the
question. As I told you when I wrote,
we intend to take her."</p>

<p>"Didn't you get my second letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I saw by that you did not
quite understand mine to you. I wrote
in a hurry, and I suppose I did not make
myself clear."</p>

<p>Constantia Dalrymple was under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
impression that she was the most truthful
of women.</p>

<p>"You made yourself perfectly clear,"
answered Lucretia, with a quiet dignity
which was not usual with her. "But
before you spoke of taking the child, I
had made up my mind to do so. I have
spoken to Fanny about it, and she is
perfectly willing to accept the extra
economies we shall have to practise, and
any trouble Amy will give her. Of
course, I shall take charge of her myself."</p>

<p>"How good of Fanny! I have always
thought she must have enough to do with
the whole work of your house, and she
works a good deal in the garden, too,
does she not?"</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia looked a trifle uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"I think Fanny will enjoy having a
young life about the house," she replied,
rather hurriedly; "just as I shall myself."</p>

<p>Constantia smiled. It was not exactly a
nice smile, but perhaps she did not know
that.</p>

<p>"I do not think either you or Fanny
have had much to do with children,"
she said. "It is all very well to have
them with you for a few hours at a time,
when they are in their best frocks and
on their best behaviour, and you have
nothing to do with them except amuse
them. But when you have the whole
responsibility of a child, and are obliged
to look after her from morning till night,
it is a very different thing."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Miss Lucretia.</p>

<p>It was that very fact, comprising as
it did the constant demand on time and
thought and labour, with all the rich
reward of corresponding affection from
the child in its dependence, that made
the sweetness of this dream of motherhood.
But Lucretia could not put this
into words. She was never very fluent
with her deeper ideas, which were,
perhaps, instincts rather than formulated
notions, and she was least fluent of all
with Constantia.</p>

<p>"And how could you ever afford it?"
went on Mrs. Dalrymple.</p>

<p>Lucretia explained her scheme of retrenchment,
and all her little plans.</p>

<p>"But you won't be able to go on dressing
Amy with your old things for ever," said
Constantia. "And, then, there will be
hats and boots and shoes.</p>

<p>"She may be ill, too; children have to
go through measles and whooping-cough,
and that sort of thing: how will you
afford to pay the doctor?"</p>

<p>Lucretia was silent for a moment; Constantia
had such a very convincing way of
saying things, and making all that was
unpractical and visionary appear so; but
she was not really vanquished.</p>

<p>"I think one must trust for that&mdash;&mdash;" she
began, at which Constantia smiled again.</p>

<p>"How about schooling, too? A girl's
education is a very expensive thing nowadays.
I am sure Edie and Gwendoline
have cost us as much as the boys."</p>

<p>"Amy is only five now, and for some
years to come I think of teaching her
myself." The present tense this time,
for she was on her mettle. "You know
we were very thoroughly grounded by
Miss Cox."</p>

<p>"That is a long time ago, Lucretia!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a long time, but I suppose the
principles of grammar and arithmetic are
the same, and I have not forgotten how to
read!"</p>

<p>It surprised Mrs. Dalrymple to see her
sister pluck up so much spirit, but this
defiant attitude did not affect her.
There was in her such a certainty of being
in the right, and of causing the right to
prevail, that she was able to take all
Lucretia's opposition very quietly. It was
obstinate of her sister to hold out like
this&mdash;weak people always were obstinate&mdash;and
it was extremely foolish, but her surrender
was only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Lucretia went on talking, urging her suit
in a way that would have struck some
people as pathetic, but Constantia was not
much given to seeing the pathos in life; her
view of things in general was optimistic,
and unless a sorrow was thrust before
her she did not look at it.</p>

<p>Constantia let Lucretia talk on until
she naturally ceased, after repeating herself
a good many times, in the way that
peculiarly weakens a cause. Then she
brought up her reserve force.</p>

<p>"But do you think it would be good for
the child to be by herself, just with you
and old Fanny?"</p>

<p>Fanny was ten years younger than her
mistress, and Lucretia realised how very
old fifty-nine must be.</p>

<p>Constantia paused a moment. Then she
went on to point out all the drawbacks of
a bringing-up such as Amy must have with
two old maids&mdash;not using the term, but
dwelling on the characteristics implied
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would you do with the child if
she were naughty?" Mrs. Dalrymple asked
by way of a test question. "She is sure to
have a strong will of her own; you know
what poor Ann was."</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia could not answer the question,
naughtiness seeming to her as multi-form
a thing as illness, and the treatment
for either depending upon its form and
cause. She replied that her idea was to
bring the child up on a system of love; a
vague answer which did not satisfy her
sister.</p>

<p>"Bringing up children is not such an
easy and simple matter as people might
think who have had no experience."
Here Constantia herself stood on a firm
foundation. "And it is much more
difficult to bring up one child by itself
than when there are others for it to
consort with."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Dalrymple proceeded to
dilate on the smallness of Primrose
Cottage, which was certainly a very poor
little place compared with The Towers.
There Amy would have the grounds to
play about in; she would share the girls'
governess, ride on Gwendoline's pony, and
Nurse, who had been so splendid with
Bertram and Edie, would only be too
pleased to have a child again.</p>

<p>"It always makes her and me quite
unhappy to look at the empty nursery,"
said Mrs. Dalrymple, "though the children
have only flown into the schoolroom."</p>

<p>There was a weight of truth in every
sentence Constantia uttered, which made
it strike like a battering-ram against the
walls of Miss Lucretia's airy castle. At
last she gave a little cry&mdash;a cry in words:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't tell me that I mustn't have
Amy!"</p>

<p>"I do not say that you must not have
her," answered Constantia. "As you say,
you are the child's godmother, and the
elder of us two. I leave it for you to
decide. Only, I want you to think which
would really be best for Amy."</p>

<p>Released thus, suddenly and unexpectedly,
from the paws of the cat, the little
mouse of Miss Lucretia's soul ran trembling
into a corner, while the cat smiled, sweetly
enough this time, as those may who have
won the game. It was a good cat, too,
which had only been doing its duty.</p>

<p>At this moment, Fanny came in, bringing
tea, and Mrs. Dalrymple greeted her
with her usual warmth and kindness, rejoicing
in the anticipation of eating some
of that delicious home-made cake which
was always so much better than they
could get their cook at The Towers to make;
asking with sympathy after Fanny's
rheumatism, and giving her an abundance
of those smiles which were so taking;
while Lucretia sat, looking old and small
and withered, with a face that seemed as
if it would never smile again.</p>

<p>She had come to her hour of sacrifice;
the great sacrifice of her life. Even with
Lucretia the age was not past when sacrifices
may be lit up by a golden halo of
romance. There had been a halo round
the sacrifice of all her little comforts which
she had already made in will for Amy.
The love that prompted it had turned the
self-denial into a part of the joy of her
prospective guardianship.</p>

<p>But round this sacrifice there hovered
no such brightness. It was only like
herself, a poor, common-place, drab-coloured
thing. No sense of heroism
could attend it; common-sense demanded
it, so Constantia had proved,
but, even with Constantia's provings,
Lucretia could not have offered up her precious
sacrifice upon the altar of common-sense.
But the other altar, which stood
hard by, the altar of love, was one that
she could not thus disdain. The result of
the pitiful struggle was certain, or Constantia
would not have given the game
into Lucretia's hands; but Lucretia was
not sharp enough to see that. To her the
whole brunt of choosing was as real, the
action of her will as decided, as if a long
habit of unselfishness had not made any
other course impossible.</p>

<p>It was better for Amy that she should go
to Constantia. Then to Constantia she
must go.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," she said at
last, in words as commonplace as befitted
her unheroic sacrifice.</p>

<p>"I was sure you would agree with me
when you came to think about it," Constantia
answered, gently now, for it was
part of her system, the one, perhaps,
which had made it so successful with her
children, never to use unnecessary force.
"I am sure a month hence you will feel
very glad that you have not a child
turning your peaceful life and your pretty
cottage upside down."</p>

<p>There was no use trying to make Constantia
understand; and, if she could
have understood, it would have made no
difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Lucretia said nothing. It was time
now for Mrs. Dalrymple to go, and,
finishing her second cup of tea, she wished
her sister an affectionate good-bye, with
the promise of a hamper of game from The
Towers, where they were just going to
have one of their "big shoots."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">She had come to the great sacrifice of her life.</p>
<p>H V Brock</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Perhaps I might have done it more
kindly," Constantia thought, as she drove
in her cab to the station. "But it was
such a foolish idea. I am glad Lucretia
saw it for herself in the end."</p>

<p>Miss Lucretia went upstairs with slow,
old footsteps, after her sister had gone.
The last red glow had faded from her
landscape, and everything was grey again,
a shade deeper grey now, as it must go on
growing deeper, till the night. She went
into the little room, and, as she looked at
the little bed which was never to hold her
child, a tear came up into each of her eyes
and trickled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>The doll lay on the bed, wrapped up in
the white muslin that was to have made
its underclothes, looking like a tiny corpse.
It seemed to Lucretia like her dream of
motherhood as it was now, the dead body
of something that had never really lived.</p>

<p>She went to the window and looked out
on the grey, darkening landscape, and
over it there twinkled one faint star.
She stood watching, and the star grew
brighter, then another came out, and
then another. For a long time Lucretia
looked up: then she knelt down, looking
up still.</p>

<p>The far-off light from the stars seemed
to be shining on her face as she turned it
to Fanny, when that faithful woman came
up at last to bring her mistress down to
supper.</p>

<p>"Miss Amy is going to Mrs. Dalrymple,"
she said, quietly, and with a little smile.
"My sister left it to me to decide whether
she should go to The Towers or come here,
and I gave her up to them, Fanny. I am
glad she is going to my sister. She will be
happier there."</p>

<h2>SOME FAMOUS EASTER HYMNS</h2>

<p>There can be no two opinions as
to the most famous Easter hymn.
In almost every church throughout
the land, and in most chapels
too, there arises, every Easter
morning, the well-known strains of
"Jesus Christ is risen to-day, Alleluia!"
There may be an occasional difference in
the wording of a line here and there, as
the hymn appears in various hymnals,
but practically it is the one hymn which
binds all Christian congregations together
on Easter morning. It is our
Easter greeting one to another, in the
joy and hope of that blessed day, like
the greeting of the pious Russian on the
same morn, who salutes every passer-by
with the words "Christ is risen!"</p>

<p>It is strange, therefore, that no one
has even an indistinct notion as to who
wrote this famous hymn. Its author is,
and long has been, unknown; and, equally
strange, there is almost the same to be
said of the composer of its famous tune.
For the tune is as great a favourite as the
words, and, in fact, whilst the words do
occasionally alter, as stated, the tune is
ever the same one we know so well. The
honour of being its composer has by
some been ascribed to Henry Carey, but
there are no certain grounds for the
assumption, fine musician though he
was. So completely has this tune associated
itself, however, with the hymn
that few people are aware that some
collections of hymns have alternative
tunes to the great song of praise for
Easter Day. But even Monk's tune to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
in "Hymns Ancient and Modern," takes
quite an inferior place; it is seldom, or
never, used.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus054.jpg" width="250" height="315" alt="Turpin" />
<div class="caption"><p>(<em>Photo: Elliott and Fry, Baker Street, W.</em>)</p>

<p class="center">DR. E. H. TURPIN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Possibly the immense popularity of
"Jesus Christ is risen to-day" depends
on two things. Firstly, the words are
extremely simple&mdash;a little child can understand
them; secondly, the tune is one
of the very best "congregational"
ones of any collection.</p>

<p>Were I asked to name the
next favourite Easter hymn, I
should certainly give the palm
to one of the most beautiful
hymns of the Church of Christ&mdash;a
hymn which has solaced
and sustained the hearts of
thousands in their dark hours
of grief for the loss of their
loved ones, just as it has rejoiced
the hearts of so many
loving servants of the Master
at their Easter festivals. I
refer to Baring-Gould's touching
hymn "On the Resurrection
morning."</p>

<p>The comfort derived from the
sweet words of hope and promise
in this hymn by members
of the Church militant here on
earth will never be known till
that "Resurrection morning."</p>

<p>The Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould has kindly
given me, for <span class="smcap">The Quiver</span>, a copy of the
manuscript of this hymn, and a few notes
about it which cannot but prove interesting.
It was composed on May Day, in 1864,
he says; and, certainly, that is appropriate
enough, for do not all poets sing of May
Day as a special day for the awakening
and rejoicing of nature? Horbury,
that robust Yorkshire village where Mr.
Baring-Gould was then the curate, was
the birthplace of "On the Resurrection
morning," as it was of what has proved
one of the six most "popular" hymns
of the world, viz. "Onward, Christian
soldiers." So Horbury enjoys no mean
fame. No one speaks more lovingly of
Horbury than does its former curate, now
so famous; and Horbury&mdash;church, chapel,
and "non-connected"&mdash;is proud to a degree
of Sabine Baring-Gould and of the
fame he has for ever given its name by
these and other noted hymns.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<p class="center">(<em>Facsimile of Dr. Turpin's Musical Setting.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that there is a word
or two slightly different in the author's
copy from those of the usually printed text.
In one case his manuscript is not perhaps
the better. "Which shall never, through
long ages, pass away," is not, in the writer's
opinion, grander than "Which shall not,
through endless ages, pass away."
Dr. E. H. Turpin's fine tune to "On the
Resurrection morning" has the merit of
exactly suiting it. All can sing it, and
that makes it so popular. The composer,
with great kindness, has also allowed me
to reproduce his manuscript of it here;
and it is only fair to say that did the
renown of the celebrated organist, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
composer, depend only on this one tune,
so linked to the hymn, it would not easily
perish whilst joyful hearts on Easter Day,
and sad hearts at the graveside of loved
ones, join in singing "On the Resurrection
morning."</p>

<p class="center">FACSIMILE OF THE COMPOSER'S ORIGINAL SETTING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To the Rev. J. M. Neale, who died
about the time when Baring-Gould wrote
the hymn just spoken of, the Christian
world is indebted for three splendid Easter
hymns. Of these it is difficult to say which
is the finest, though perhaps, being quite
original, we should give that honour to
the well-known "The foe behind, the deep
before." Every section of the Church of
Christ sings with deep and solemn pathos
those beautiful lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"No longer must the mourners weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor call departed Christians dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For death is hallow'd into sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And every grave is but a bed"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>

<p>following so closely on the joyful strain of
"Christ is risen!" in the preceding verse.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>(<em>Photo: William Gill, Colchester.</em>)</p>

<p class="center"><em>Arthur H. Brown.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>To this hymn innumerable tunes have
been composed by musical people of
various degrees of ability; but it has
always seemed to me that by far the best
are the two tunes given to it in the
Wesleyan hymn-book, and, curious to
relate, the composers are both ministers,
the Rev. Olinthus R. Barnicott and the
Rev. Sidney J. P. Dunman. And it may
safely be said that the singing by an
average Wesleyan congregation of this
fine hymn, to either of these fine tunes,
will not be easily forgotten by the person
who hears it for the first time.</p>

<p>The two other famous Easter hymns of
Dr. Neale's composition were really translations
from the Greek. Nevertheless, they
are grand translations, if one may say
so. "The Day of Resurrection"&mdash;best
recognised when sung to the tune composed
by Berthold Tours, the celebrated
composer is a regular favourite at Easter-tide;
but even more famous is the other
hymn from the Greek&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Come, ye faithful, raise the strain<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of triumphant gladness."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>This hymn may safely be placed amongst
the most popular of Easter favourites, and,
like so many others, whilst excellent in
its words, it owes not a little of its fame
to its fine tune. This latter was composed
by Mr. Arthur Henry Brown, of Brentwood,
and was called "St. John Damascene,"
under which name it still figures in
the various Church hymn-books. Mr.
Brown told me that the tune was composed
in less than a quarter of an hour!
But he also told me that even that was
eclipsed by the tune "St. Anatolius"&mdash;does
any hymn-lover not know it?&mdash;to "The
day is past and over," which was composed
in five minutes! Truly that was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
"inspired" five minutes, for which the
Christian Church has reason to be thankful!</p>

<p>To the late Bishop of Lincoln, Dr. Christopher
Wordsworth&mdash;who that knew the
saintly old man did not love him?&mdash;the
world is indebted for the ever-popular</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Alleluia! Alleluia!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hearts to Heav'n and voices raise,"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>which always goes with "a good swing"
on Easter morn. Its tone is "victory"
from beginning to end, and there are
few more beautiful Easter verses than
the first one of this hymn.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Sullivan composed its tune&mdash;the
one best known, "Lux Eoi"&mdash;and
the very lilt of the music seems
somehow to suggest the work of the great
musician who gave us similar "swinging"
tunes for "Onward, Christian soldiers"
("St. Gertrude") and for "The Jubilee
Hymn." But Sir Arthur tells me that
"Lux Eoi" was not composed especially
for this hymn, but for another one less
famous. The rapidity of Sir Arthur's composition
is only equalled by that of Arthur
H. Brown, already mentioned. The gifted
composer of <cite>The Golden Legend</cite> thinks
long before he puts pen to paper, and
often defers doing this "till the last
minute," as we say; but when he <em>does</em> get
started, he goes at it as few composers can,
and will polish off the introduction to an
oratorio in a night!</p>

<p>"When I survey the wondrous Cross,"
that splendid old hymn of that splendid
old divine, Dr. Isaac Watts, is probably
one of our very oldest hymns that is at
all well known to-day. Everybody sings
it, for everybody knows both words
and tune: Englishman, native African,
Brother Jonathan, converted Chinese, all
sing alike from the heart, after they
have felt the real significance and power
of that death and resurrection&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Love so amazing, so divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Demands my life, my soul, my all!"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>"Rockingham," the tune to which this
hymn is eternally wedded, was composed
by Dr. Edward Miller. There is a
magnificent roll and stateliness about it
which suits the words perfectly, and the
wonderful magnetic force which comes
over one as one listens to six thousand
people&mdash;led by, say, Mr. Ira D. Sankey,
singing "When I survey the wondrous
Cross"&mdash;was well described by the nameless
slave in America, who, hearing it
thus sung by a crowd, and being reproved
for humming the tune as the
people sang, said, "Massa, it no use;
me <em>must</em> jine in!"</p>

</div>

<p>A living hymn-writer of no small fame&mdash;the
present Archbishop of York&mdash;has
given us one of the very finest of the
hymns for this season. Though not popular
in the sense that Dr. Watts' celebrated
hymn is, yet there are few more
charmingly beautiful lines, suggestive
of Good Friday and Easter thoughts,
than are found in Dr. Maclagan's hymn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
"Lord, when Thy Kingdom comes,
remember me!"</p>

<p>This hymn is one of the best-known of
the Archbishop's, though, of course, his
most famous one is the ever-beautiful
"The Saints of God, their conflict past."</p>

<p>We cannot pass by without notice the
Rev. John Ellerton's "Welcome, happy
morning," and the Rev. F. W. Faber's very
sweetly sad "O come and mourn with
me awhile," which, of course, is a hymn
for Good Friday. The tune to this was
written by the celebrated Durham man
to whom the Church of England (and all
denominations) will ever be in debt for
some of the sweetest hymn-tunes the
world has ever known&mdash;Dr. J. B. Dykes.
And it was fitting that he who composed
the beautiful tune to "Our blest Redeemer,"
for Whitsuntide, should then
give us another ever-famous tune to
Faber's grand words.</p>

<p>Let me close this brief account of some
of our finest Easter hymns by just recalling
one or two of our finest Easter
anthems. Of course, the first, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>,
is the immortal "I know that my
Redeemer liveth"; and equally with it,
from the same "oratorio of oratorios,"
is the "Hallelujah" Chorus. Of these
what shall be said? Shall it be told
again how Handel thought he was in
heaven when he wrote them? Or shall
we note that the "Hallelujah" Chorus
is one of the three pieces of music in the
world on hearing which every Briton
stands up and doffs his hat? These are
the National Anthem, the "Dead March"
in <cite>Saul</cite>, and the "Hallelujah" Chorus.
In the first he pays his tribute to his
earthly sovereign; in the second he pays
his last tribute to the venerated dead;
in the third he acknowledges the tribute
due to his Almighty Lord, the Sovereign
of Heaven.</p>

<p class="center"><em>John Stainer</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Apart from these two masterpieces of
Handel, the prettiest and most beautiful
Easter anthem is that of Dr. Stainer, composed
for the cantata <em>The Raising of
Jairus' Daughter</em>. In a wide experience
of cathedral music and anthem-singing
by our best choirs, I doubt if there is
any much finer musical treat than to
listen to the choir of St. Paul's, or that
of York Minster, as there rolls forth that
most beautiful of anthems, words and
music&mdash;"Awake, thou that sleepest, and
arise from the dead, and God shall give
thee light." This is, indeed, a noble song
for "Easter's bright morning," and well
may its words be taken as our special
Easter thought; for to all of us, in some
way or other, they must have a special
meaning.</p>

<h2>SELF-HEALING.</h2>

<p class="center">By The Rev. Hugh Macmillan, D.D., L.L.D.</p>

<h3>"Physician, heal thyself."&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Luke</span> iv. 23.</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus058a.jpg" alt="W" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">]We are accustomed
to think that
the healing
virtue there is
in herbs and
trees was meant
only for man;
that herbs and
trees were
created with
these virtues in
them for the
special purpose
of curing our human diseases and ministering
to our human wants, and for nothing else; that
God had man in view in the beginning when
He gave these medicinal qualities to plants,
and apart from man's use of them they serve
no other purpose.</p>
</div>

<p>Now this, which is a common, widespread
idea, is an altogether erroneous one. For if
God meant these vegetable qualities and
products exclusively for man's use, the
questions may be pertinently asked, Why
were they so long undiscovered; and why
do they occur in places often remote from
human habitation, and waste themselves upon
the desert air?</p>

<p>It is true indeed that God designed them
as remedies for man's ailments, that He
prepared beforehand the cures of human
ills long previous to the necessity for
these cures arising. But this law of mercy
was a comprehensive one, and had a two-fold
object in view. God in the first place
created the plant complete in itself, adapted
to its own circumstances and requirements;
and in the second place, it is through this
perfect adaptability to its own wants that
it becomes generally useful in nature, and
ministers to the necessities of other created
things. It is because the plant heals itself
first by the remedy which it grows and produces
by its own powers that it becomes
a medicine to the animal world, when any
members of that world are placed in similar circumstances
and exposed to a similar disease.</p>

<p>Why, for instance, does the Peruvian bark
tree produce the bitter principle in its bark
from which we have prepared the valuable
medicine called quinine? Is it not because
that bitter principle is necessary to preserve
the health of the tree itself in the wet,
malarial districts where it grows? The
Peruvian bark tree grows its own quinine,
and administers it to itself, as it were, in
order to prevent a disease in itself caused
by the marshy places where it is found,
similar to fever in the human subject. The
willow grows beside rivers and streams which
are apt to cause exhalations and breed influences
that are noxious to the well-being
of the tree. It has therefore developed in
its own bark a febrifuge called salicin, which
protects it from these noxious influences
and maintains its trunk and branches and
foliage in vigorous health and beauty. And
it is because the quinine is good for the
tree itself in malarial places that it is good
for the fever which human beings take in
such places; and it is because the salicin
of the willow guards the tree from the
injurious exhalations of marshes and river
banks that it is a specific for rheumatism in
man, which is produced by the same causes.</p>

<p>The same benefit which the medicinal
principle developed by itself works in its
own constitution it confers upon man when
subjected to the same evil. And so it is
with all the herbal medicines. They have a
purpose to serve in the economy of the
plant that yields them before they can
minister to human sickness and disease.
Sugar was not meant in the first instance
to sweeten man's cup, but to store up food
for the plant in order to enable it to flower.
Tannin is created in the bark of the oak
tree, in the first instance, not for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
of helping to make leather for man's shoes,
but for the purpose of preventing mildew and
fungous growths from settling on the bark
of the tree and so decaying it. Scent is
produced in flowers and shrubs that grow in
watery places, not for man's gratification in
the first instance, but in order to deodorise
the air and make it fit for these scented
flowers and shrubs to breathe and to preserve
their vitality and vigour. Aromatic fragrance
is yielded by the grey shrubs and herbs of
the dry desert, not that the garments of the
human passer-by might smell pleasantly of
it, but that it might regulate the temperature,
and keep the plants cool in the burning
heat of the noonday and warm in the
freezing cold of the night air.</p>

<p>Such instances might be multiplied indefinitely.
Indeed, it may be regarded as
a rule of nature without exception that,
whatever properties plants possess that are
useful to man, these properties, in the first
instance, are not only useful but indispensable
to themselves. And it is because they serve
necessary uses in their own economy that
they are found so necessary in the economy
of man. Each plant that grows in circumstances
where it is likely to be injured by
the soil or climate develops within itself the
antidotes and remedies against these unfavourable
circumstances. It is a physician
that heals itself first of all, that adapts itself
as perfectly as possible to the peculiarities of
its own place of growth. Nature and it are
harmonious: they help each other. The qualities
that are beneficial to itself are equally in
the same way beneficial to other creatures;
and it helps the world because it has first
helped itself. It imparts health all around
because it looks first after its own health.</p>

<p>All this is obvious. The plant could not
exist at all did it not develop those qualities
which would minister to its welfare
and adjust it perfectly to its environment.
But in human economy we fancy somehow
that the law is less strict and more irregular,
and can be violated at times with impunity.
We think that a man can perform the part
of a physician, and cure others, although he
cannot cure a trouble that afflicts himself;
that he can restore others to health while
he himself is unhealthy. We can separate
between a man's skill and his personality;
and, indeed, there are many cases where a
physician who is dying slowly of some incurable
disease can yet, by his knowledge and cleverness,
so treat his patients that he may heal
their diseases and restore them to health and
strength. But we are usually suspicious of
a doctor endeavouring to cure others when
he himself labours under an uncured disease.
We reason naturally that his first concern
should be himself; and if he fails in doing
good to himself by his skill and medicine,
when his interests are most of all concerned
and the motive for healing strongest, how
can he hope to succeed in the case of others,
strangers and comparatively indifferent to
him? We should not accept with implicit
confidence a so-called remedy for baldness
forced upon our notice by a person whose
own head was in that condition. We should
expect him to operate upon himself in the
first instance with success, and then we
should feel disposed to venture upon a
similar use of it. The proverb says that
"He who drives fat cattle must himself be
fat"; and upon the principle involved in
that common saying he who would heal
others must himself be a specimen of that
active, vigorous health to which he wishes
to restore others. In no work, indeed, is the
personal equation of more consequence than
in the work of the physician. Three-fourths
of the elements that enter into all diseases
are spiritual, and three-fourths of the remedies
that must be used for them must also be
spiritual. The personal appearance, character,
and manner of the physician himself are most
important factors in the cure of disease. Confidence
in the doctor is more than half the
cure; and therefore what the doctor is in
himself is of great consequence.</p>

<p>In the spiritual sphere the physician can
only heal others as he heals himself. He
himself must be an exemplification of the
saving health of God's countenance if he is
to do good to others. It is just as true in
the affairs of the human soul as it is in the
case of the plant&mdash;that the quality which is
beneficial to the soul itself is equally beneficial
to the world. It is noticeable, however,
that there are exceptions to the rule
in the spiritual world as there are exceptions
in the natural human world. Just as there
are cases of physicians healing bodily diseases
in others while their own disease is unhealed,
so there are cases where a man is the
means of saving others while he himself is
unsaved.</p>

<p>It is not, indeed, a matter of supposition,
but of certainty, that a man may do
good while he is not good. Hundreds of
instances could be given, in which persons
have been the means of quickening, comforting,
and building up souls in the Lord, while
all the time they themselves were strangers
to the power of truth and ignorant of the
love of Christ in their hearts. Ministers have
preached the Gospel for years, and have been
wise in bringing souls to Christ, and yet
have themselves been castaways in the end.
Members of churches have been zealous in
every good work, and yet have known nothing
of godliness but the form. The very commonness
of this thing increases its sadness. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
think the case of Moses leading the Israelites
to the border of the Promised Land while he
himself was forbidden to enter peculiarly
pathetic; but its pathos is in reality far less
touching than the case of the man who brings
others to the fountain of life while he himself
is perishing of thirst, who is like a guide-post
pointing the way of salvation to others while
unable himself to take a single step.</p>

<p>But though instances have unquestionably
occurred in which signal beneficial results have
followed the preaching of the Gospel by ungodly
men, this is not the normal order of the Divine
procedure. It is personal experience of religion
as an inward life, as a living power in
the heart, that imparts unction to active
Christian effort, that adds conviction and
power to testimony and commendation. He
is the man to do spiritual good to others
who is able to say with the Apostle, "That
which we have heard, which we have seen
with our eyes, and our hands have handled,
of the word of life, declare we unto you,
that ye also may have fellowship with us."
He is the man to say to others, "O taste
and see that the Lord is good," who has himself
tasted, and from his own enjoyment can say,
"Blessed is the man that trusteth in Him."</p>

<p>It is an unchangeable law and constitution
of our nature that we cannot desire blessings
for others which we do not really desire for
ourselves, the blessedness of which we have
not known ourselves. When we feel the
value of our own souls, and not till then,
we shall feel the value of the souls of others.
When we see the Lord ourselves, and not till
then, we shall desire that every child of man
shall see Him.</p>

<p>It is on this account that our Lord says
to Peter, "When thou art converted,
strengthen thy brethren." "Simon, son of
Jonas, lovest thou Me? Feed My sheep;
feed My lambs." If we are saved ourselves,
we shall be best fitted to save and benefit
others. There is a virtue in true holiness,
there is a secret charm in the wisdom that
cometh from above, which wins our hearts,
and inclines us to embrace a religion which
yields such blessed fruits. The man who
eminently possesses and constantly exhibits
these qualities becomes quick and powerful in
acting upon the minds of those around him.</p>

<p>The best way, then, to do good is to be
good, and to have such a Christian character
as will of itself communicate good. Be yourself
what you wish your family, your friends
and neighbours, to be. "Physician, heal thyself."
God needs physicians, many physicians;
for there are many destroyers spreading the
influence of their ungodly life&mdash;a deadly infection&mdash;around,
and adding to the disease
and misery which man's sin first brought
upon the world. Let us act as fellow-workers
with the Good Physician in bringing back
health and strength and beauty to a plague-stricken
world; and for this purpose let us
qualify ourselves more thoroughly. Let us
apply the Gospel remedies anew to our own
case which we recommend to others, that
our own profiting and healing by these may
be made manifest to all. Let us ask God
to search us and see if there be anything
that would prevent us from doing
all the good that we might, any defect of
manner or disposition of heart that might
cause the way of truth so far as we are
concerned to be evil spoken of; and let
us ask the help of the Divine Spirit to get
it healed. So that thus being made every
whit whole ourselves, we may diffuse a
healthy atmosphere around us and make
others partakers of our saving health.</p>

<p>The Sabbath is the best day for healing.
Jesus asked the Jews, "Is it lawful to heal
on the Sabbath day?" The reply might
have been, "Is it lawful to do anything else
but heal on the Sabbath day?" That day
is set apart for healing the diseases of the
world. It is the day of recreation&mdash;re-creating
us and fitting us anew by its rest and
refreshment of worship for the toil and
travail of our weekday life. Let us bring
to Jesus on this Sabbath day all the old
infirmities and disabilities which have been
a hindrance to the growth of the work of
grace in the midst of us, and He will deliver
us from them, and make us new creatures;
and so&mdash;set free in newness of health and
strength, with our palsied frame invigorated,
our withered hand restored, our lame feet
made swift in the way of God's commandments,
and our world-bound spirit loosed
from its infirmity and covetousness, and
enabled to look upward where our true
treasure is&mdash;let us seek to free others from
their infirmities and diseases, and to make
all around us strong in faith and health in
the new life of God's service.</p>

<p>Let the tonic that has restored our own
spiritual constitution be in all our words and
deeds and looks, to restore the spiritual constitution
of others. Let the perfume that
neutralises the drought and cold of the world
be exhaled from all our character and conduct,
so that it may be the means of enabling all
with whom we come in contact to resist the
aridity and the coldness of the world too.
Let each of us be so full of Christ's healing
and saving power, so saturated with His
salvation, as it were, that we ourselves
may be Christ's best medicines. Let the
words "Physician, heal thyself" be in the
very forefront of our profession and of our
life throughout all the years; and we ourselves
in such a case will be among the most
potent influences for good in the world.</p>

<p class="cap_1">Beside the Wishing Well stood
Anthony Trevithick, pale
and moody. His eyes were
on the ground, and an old
childish habit of biting his
nails when he was perplexed
or in trouble had
come back to him.</p>
</div>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said
Lord Glengall at his elbow.
"I have returned for some things Miss Graydon
left behind her."</p>

<p>"These?" asked the young fellow, pointing
with his foot to the little heap of trinkets on
the moss. But even in his anger he blushed
for the unhappiness of the position.</p>

<p>Lord Glengall stooped and picked up the
things, and stuffed them into one of the pockets
of his rough coat. He turned as if to go away.
Then he hesitated an instant and came back.</p>

<p>"There is no reason why we should be
enemies," he said, advancing a step nearer.</p>

<p>"No?" replied Anthony Trevithick, lifting
his moody eyes. "That depends."</p>

<p>"On what, sir?"</p>

<p>"On&mdash;a great many things," stammered the
young man.</p>

<p>"You mean on whether I am prepared to
stand aside and to sacrifice everything that
you may have your will. I know the state
of affairs, you see."</p>

<p>"I meant to seek you out and tell you, Lord
Glengall. I ought to say, perhaps, that Miss
Graydon is without reproach in this matter."</p>

<p>"Neither of us is likely to wrong her in our
thoughts, I hope," said Lord Glengall. "The
question is, whether <em>you</em> are without reproach."</p>

<p>"By what right&mdash;&mdash;" began the younger
man.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the other, with a dignity that
was more compelling than his words. "We
are speaking as man to man. Miss Graydon
has told me something of how affairs lay
between you and her, but not all. Why did
you leave her in the first instance in the
position of a half-engaged girl?"</p>

<p>"Are you her ambassador?"</p>

<p>"She is dearer to me, I dare swear, than
she is to you, though you will not believe
it. There is no use in beating about the bush.
If I think you can make her happier than
I can, I am prepared to give her back her
promise."</p>

<p>"Lord Glengall!"</p>

<p>A gesture silenced the words on his lips.</p>

<p>"Don't say anything, please. If I do it, I do
it for her. And I shall only give her up to you
if I am sure you are worthy."</p>

<p>"I don't say I am worthy, but I have a fairly
clean record. As for that matter, I will explain.
I was unwise, but I was not altogether to blame.
My mother has a greatly loved young cousin.
She has been in the house with us since her
mother died some years ago. It was a scheme
of my mother's that we should marry, though
it was not openly expressed. I did not oppose
it. I had no idea what love meant till I saw
Pamela; but I had fetched and carried for
Lady Kitty. Probably a great number of
people thought we were engaged; and it
seemed to me that I ought to set the matter
straight before I was formally engaged to
Pamela."</p>

<p>"It would have been better to have let
Pamela alone till you were quite free."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There; you are young. You can't be
expected to be as deliberate as an older man.
You meant to act straight by her?"</p>

<p>"I meant to come back in a week a free man.
When I was called away to my uncle's sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
bed, my mother made me promise not to speak,
not to try to clear up things with Lady Kitty,
till I returned. I did write to Mr. Graydon,
but the letter never reached him." He blushed
hotly and paused.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," interrupted Lord Glengall.
"When you came back?"</p>

<p>"When I came back, I found&mdash;Pamela engaged
to you, and my cousin engaged to a
great friend of mine. As it proved, she had
never thought of me in that way; but her
affection for my mother prevented her from
speaking out."</p>

<p>"You should have written again to Mr.
Graydon. You made Pamela unhappy."</p>

<p>"I thought he had not written because I
said I would come as soon as I
could. Then I was kept week
after week, till the time turned
into months. I am deeply sorry
that I caused her unhappiness."</p>

<p>"This is the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth?"</p>

<p>"It is absolutely the truth, and
nothing else."</p>

<p>"Very well, Sir Anthony, I
believe you. If you had not
been straight, I should have held
her to the letter of her bond
against you and the world, even
against herself. Now&mdash;in her
heart she has chosen you, and
you are a fitter mate for her
than I&mdash;I resign her to you."</p>

<p>"Lord Glengall!"</p>

<p>"I do not ask your thanks,
sir. Make her happy&mdash;that is
all. For the rest, I have one
word of advice for you."</p>

<p>"Whatever it is, I shall act
upon it."</p>

<p>"Go back to-night to England."</p>

<p>"Without a word to
Pamela?"</p>

<p>"Let her be. I will say
what is necessary. You
will have to win her
again, young sir. She is
not the girl to change her
lovers like her frocks."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right,
sir," with hesitation.</p>

<p>"Go," said Lord Glengall,
waving him away,
"go! If you speak to her
in her present mood, you
will be sorry. Let her be
free of both of us for a
while."</p>

<p>"You, too, will leave
her?"</p>

<p>"I shall leave her till
all this is forgotten. It
will be nothing new for me to set out for
the ends of the earth at an hour's notice."</p>

<p>"You are, as Pamela says, the best man
living."</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Lord Glengall, with a gesture
as if he could not endure the praise. "Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye," repeated Sir Anthony, turning
away.</p>

<p>Several times as he went homeward Lord
Glengall stooped to pat the shaggy coat of the
terrier who still trotted by him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<p>"You don't know poetry, old fellow," he said
once aloud, "but there was a poet named
Shakespeare who wrote something about
people coming back 'to push us from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
stools.' I am not good at remembering poetry;
but that young gentleman we have just left
has come back to push us from our stools&mdash;to
push us from our stools."</p>

<p>The dog, as if he understood, thrust a sympathetic
nose into his companion's hand.</p>

<p>When Lord Glengall reached Carrickmoyle,
he went straight to Mr. Graydon's room.
Mary was sitting by her father, stitching a
piece of fine white stuff in the twilight.</p>

<p>"Ah! Glengall," said the invalid briskly.
"Have you come in to smoke a last pipe
with me? Come and tell me what prices
were like at the fair to-day. Run away,
Molly child, and rest your eyes, and let
Glengall have your seat."</p>

<p>The two men lit up soberly, and smoked
away for a while, discussing prices and cattle
and crops in a desultory fashion.</p>

<p>At last Lord Glengall knocked out the
ashes from his stumpy clay against the top
bar of the grate, and stuffed the pipe into
his pocket.</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk to you about Pam,
Graydon," he said.</p>

<p>"What about Pam?"</p>

<p>"Only that I did the child an injustice
in wanting to marry her. I am too old."</p>

<p>"Does Pam say this? Are you speaking
for her?"</p>

<p>"Poor little Pam! There were some love-passages,
Graydon, between her and your
pupil Trevithick."</p>

<p>"I guessed as much, but how far the
thing went I have no idea. I don't believe
in probing into those things, Glengall. It is
better to let them die."</p>

<p>"Had you any idea that the young
fellow might possibly ask for her?"</p>

<p>"I hoped so once, not because it would
be a good marriage for Pam, or anything
of that sort, but because I thought him a
good lad, and I believed in his father's son.
I was disappointed that he turned out so
different from my expectations."</p>

<p>"Would you be surprised to hear that he
wrote to you about Pam immediately after
he left, and that his mother intercepted the
letter?"</p>

<p>"His mother!"</p>

<p>"Yes; she had other views for him."</p>

<p>"I wonder why she came here, why she
troubled our peace, and forced her hospitality
on Pam, who didn't want it?" said Mr.
Graydon musingly.</p>

<p>"To make a parting between the lad and
Pam more certain. She told Pam he was
engaged to his cousin; and in other ways
made the child's visit miserable."</p>

<p>"My poor Pam! I remember she hated
to go."</p>

<p>"I am sorry the boy has such a mother."</p>

<p>"Yet I remember her a very noble-looking
girl. I don't think she was made for mean
things."</p>

<p>"Ah! well, we can let her be. She is
sufficiently punished, poor woman, by her
son's scorn. That must be a terrible thing
to endure."</p>

<p>"And she is a proud woman."</p>

<p>"However, Graydon, we are not concerned
with her. The state of the case is this:
The young people were in love with each
other, and were parted by a fraud. Under a
total misapprehension, Pamela has engaged
herself to me. Now that the misapprehension
is removed, what is the clear course
for me to take?"</p>

<p>"I should ask Pamela, Glengall."</p>

<p>"Pamela is at this moment in a mood in
which it would not be safe to take her at
her word. The only thing for me to do is
to step down and out."</p>

<p>"Glengall!" said Mr. Graydon, laying a
hand on his.</p>

<p>"Don't pity me just now, Graydon. Frankly,
I'm not equal to it."</p>

<p>"Have you told Pam?"</p>

<p>"I shall tell her. Afterwards I shall go
away till the nine days' wonder is forgotten."</p>

<p>"Glengall, I wish this had not happened."</p>

<p>"There is one way in which you can atone
to me for its bitterness&mdash;I don't mind confessing
to you that it is bitter."</p>

<p>"And that way?"</p>

<p>"You must borrow from me what will take
you abroad. You must; it is for their
sakes."</p>

<p>"Very well; if there is no other way. I
shall repay you, I hope."</p>

<p>"You have plenty of time before you
to grow rich in. When you come back
next spring, you must finish your <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum
opus</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon rubbed his hands in boyish
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"I shall feel equal to tackling it after a
change. I'm afraid I've been vegetating,
and the mosses and mildew have grown
upon me. You have lived, Glengall, while I
was growing into a worthless old block."</p>

<p>"It is you who have lived," said Lord
Glengall. "You have lived naturally. When
I die, it is the end of my line, and I shall
have no one to close my eyes."</p>

<p>When he found Pam in the drawing-room
alone, a little later, he drew her to him,
and kissed her hair where it clustered over
the white forehead.</p>

<p>"I have brought your pretty things, Pam,"
he said, fumbling in his pocket.</p>

<p>"And you have forgiven me?"</p>

<p>"I have forgiven you, dear."</p>

<p>He fastened the little chain about her
neck and the bracelet on her wrist.</p>

<p>"You will wear them for me, Pam?" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
said. "I should not know what to do with
them."</p>

<p>"And my ring?" said Pam, wondering.</p>

<p>"I have taken back the ring. You are free,
Pam; free as air."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus064.jpg" width="450" height="475" alt="free" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"You are free, Pam; free as air."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"But I don't want to be free."</p>

<p>"You did yesterday, Pam, and you will
to-morrow. I have seen Sir Anthony, Pam.
He is guiltless, and will come again."</p>

<p>"I do not want him to come," cried Pam
with a great sob.</p>

<p>"I sent him away because I was afraid
if he came to you now you would make
him and yourself unhappy. He hated to go,
but he went. He will come again. You will
be good to him, Pam, because you love him.
Now, good-bye, my dear. I shall come back
when you are married."</p>

<p>Pamela's hands were over her eyes, and
she was crying quietly.</p>

<p>"Another thing, Pam," he said. "I have
arranged with your father. He is to winter
abroad."</p>

<p>"Sylvia will see to that," she answered.
"Miss Spencer has made it easy for her.
At least, we need not take that from you."</p>

<p>"You have given me great happiness,"
he repeated. "And now, good-bye, my dear,
good-bye."</p>

<p>A day or two later Carrickmoyle was
startled by the news that Lord Glengall
had sailed for Australia.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>"THOUGH 'TWERE TEN THOUSAND MILE."</h3>


<p>"I wish something would happen," said
Sylvia; "it is the longest summer I
have ever known."</p>

<p>Sylvia was wearing black for Miss
Spencer, who had passed away peacefully a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
few weeks after that talk with Pamela.
When the legal formalities were completed,
Sylvia would be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">châtelaine</i> of Dovercourt;
but her interest in her inheritance seemed
very slight.</p>

<p>"By-and-by," she had said, "I shall be
glad to know that I have money to do
things with; but just at present I can only
remember what it is that has made me rich."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus065.jpg" width="350" height="417" alt="marry" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"I thought you were going to marry him, Bridget."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Why not have Mr. Baker or Mr. St.
Quintin to tea quietly?" suggested Pam.
"I am sure they are longing to come, and
they would cheer you up."</p>

<p>But Sylvia would not. She preferred to
wander from the house to the garden with
the dogs at her heels, or to stray from one
room to another, having a desultory chat
with her father, who was now up and
about, or with Mary, cheerfully sewing her
bridal clothes, usually ending up with a
visit to Bridget in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Bridget quite agreed with Sylvia about
the dulness of the house, and suggested
the same remedy for it as Pamela had
done.</p>

<p>"Have a bit of company, child," she said.
"Sure, her that's gone (the heavens be her
bed!) 'ud be the last to grudge the young
what's natural to the young, let alone that
I hear young Mr. St. Quintin's that mopy
that they say 'tis to
horse-racin' he's took,
wid the design of
breakin' his neck by
way of divarsion."</p>

<p>"Don't talk such
nonsense, Bridget,"
said Sylvia languidly.
"The horse is not born
that could unseat Mr.
St. Quintin. He can
stick on like grim
death. But I don't
feel that company,
such company as I
could get, would be
any good to me. I
don't like young
people, Bridget."</p>

<p>"Well, sorra such a
house I ever was in,"
said Bridget, scandalised.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Bridget
dear," said Sylvia,
who had temporarily
lost her taste for
sharp argument with
Bridget. "I suppose
I was born old."</p>

<p>"Listen to her,"
cried Bridget, "an' she
wid the lightest feet,
aye, an' the purtiest
face in the barony!
Between you and Miss
Pamela, me heart's
fairly bruk. There's
Miss Pamela, that
ought to be goin' to
be married a week
from next Tuesday,
goin' round as mopy as a chicken wid the
pip. I never seen such goin's on anywhere I
was."</p>

<p>"It certainly <em>is</em> time," said Sylvia again,
"that something should happen, and, short
of marrying myself, Bridget, I'll do anything
to bring it about."</p>

<p>"Indeed, then Mr. St. Quintin's a pleasant
young gentleman," said Bridget, broadly
smiling, "though an imp of mischief. 'Tis
meself'll not forget in a hurry how he
whipped the steps from undher Grady whin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
he was pickin' the morello cherries, an'
never purtended he heard him bawlin' melia
murther, an' the ould rogue, as he was
contrivin' to slip down by the trunk, caught
by a twig in his breeches an' held there!
As I said to Mr. St. Quintin, I hoped he
thought then on poor Mary that's gone,
that often he made suffer, the crathur!"</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to marry him,
Bridget," said Sylvia, with the same languid
interest.</p>

<p>"Och, then, heaven forgive you, Miss Sylvia.
Sure them was only my jokes. Not but what
he axed me. 'The mischief bother you, man,'
says I. 'Is it havin' me commit murther you'd
be? Why, sure I couldn't keep me hands off
you if I was lookin' at you every day, an' then
I'd be tried an' hung for it, maybe.'"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you're not going to marry
him under the circumstances," said Sylvia.
"But, all the same, it is time some of us made
a stir."</p>

<p>And even then one thing that was to disturb
the current of their lives was on its
way.</p>

<p>The very morning after Sylvia's conversation
with Bridget there was a large square envelope
for Mr. Graydon, which somewhat exercised
his youngest daughter's imagination.</p>

<p>"Come here, dad," she said, when at last he
arrived at the breakfast-table. "I've been
longing for something to happen, and I believe
this is really a happening at last."</p>

<p>"It is my uncle's writing," said Mr. Graydon,
as he took the letter and opened it. As he
read it his face grew graver and graver.</p>

<p>"Poor old Uncle Charles!" he said, when he
had finished. "His boy is dead."</p>

<p>Lord Downshire's letter was very characteristic:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Archie</span>,&mdash;I will not say you have
scored again, but at least I have failed with
the last card I held against you. My boy is
dead. I don't ask for your sympathy or your
pity. You, with your healthy girls, cannot
appreciate what I suffer. I am racked in the
spirit and the body, and I shall be very glad
to leave a world that has lost savour for me.
I heard indirectly that you were ill after you
had been here; but, you see, <em>you</em> have recovered,
and it is my boy that is dead. You
are my heir now, and I am too sick of it all to
make another attempt to frustrate you. And
there is no use continuing in enmity against
you, so I shall make you an allowance proportionate
to the condition of my heir. I
shall not ask to see you, but Messrs. Lees and
Saunders, of Lincoln's Inn&mdash;you will remember
Saunders; Lees died last year&mdash;have my instructions."</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon put the letter into his pocket
when he had read it.</p>

<p>"Something has happened, Sylvia," he said
sorrowfully. "I am Lord Downshire's heir
once more; and yet I would a thousand times
rather be as I was, and the old man's little
son living."</p>

<p>But the happenings of the day were not
over.</p>

<p>Sylvia, going her pilgrimage to Miss Spencer's
new grave, was aware of a tall young
figure, which had something familiar about
it, swinging along towards her. Presently
she recognised Anthony Trevithick.</p>

<p>"Miss Sylvia," he said, "I am so glad I
met with you. I want to see Pamela."</p>

<p>"Pamela!" with oddly upraised eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Pamela. I have stayed away as long
as I could. I promised Lord Glengall I would
give her time."</p>

<p>"Oh! that is how it is, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; didn't you know?"</p>

<p>"I guessed, of course, but Pam is not the
old Pam. She has been as solemn as an owl,
and as secretive, ever since.... When was
it?... I really think it began about the
time of your going away. She used to be the
best of good company."</p>

<p>"What is this for, Miss Sylvia?" said the
young man, touching her black frock.</p>

<p>"Ah! You do not know. Miss Spencer died
a month ago."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said, with a sympathy
which at once made Sylvia his friend.</p>

<p>"Does Pam know you are coming?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No. I was afraid to announce myself.
Perhaps she will show me the door."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she won't, Sir Anthony. She's
fond of you, you see."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Sylvia!" cried Anthony Trevithick,
flushing delightedly through his tan.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! she's fond of you. I'm not going
to talk about her secrets, but I know how it
is. I knew all along. That is why I was so
vexed with her&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash; Never mind. You
want to see Pamela, then? Well, just wait for
me a minute outside this gate. I will come
back with you then, and find Pamela for you."</p>

<p>"You are awfully good."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'm glad to get rid of Pam. She's
prettier than I am, though some people don't
think so. Perhaps I'm afraid of her stealing
my admirers."</p>

<p>"I believe it is only your goodness to me."</p>

<p>"And to Pam. She's not the same Pam she
was a year ago. If you make her like her old
self, I shall forgive you even that you left us
forlorn and unsquired at that famous festivity
for which you should have returned."</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Sylvia, I shan't believe that."</p>

<p>She did not try Anthony Trevithick's
patience by keeping him waiting long at the
churchyard gate. She was gone only a minute
or two before she returned, her basket empty
of its flowers, and her face, which had gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
so much in character and sweetness during
the year, a little overshadowed.</p>

<p>When they reached Carrickmoyle, she
brought Anthony Trevithick through the sunny
hall where the door stood, as ever, hospitably
open, and into the big drawing-room. "Stay
here till I find Pam," she said. She went upstairs
two steps at a time in the boyish way
he remembered. He listened with a smile on
his face till the sound of the footsteps died
away. Then he began to walk up and down
nervously.</p>

<p>Pam sat in the window of her own little
room with her chin in her hands, gazing
over the summer-dark landscape, her air listless,
and her eyes apathetic.</p>

<p>"It is lonely, Sylvia," she said, scarcely turning
her head as her sister entered.</p>

<p>"You never used to find it so," said Sylvia.
"I remember the time when Carrickmoyle
held all the delights for you."</p>

<p>"That was when we were little girls in short
frocks, and led poor Mick into scrapes."</p>

<p>"Many a year ago," said Sylvia. "When
you struck Anthony Trevithick with the sun-bonnet
that was intended for the red cock&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pamela's heightened colour assured Sylvia
of what she wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Pam," she said, "why don't you make it
straight with Anthony Trevithick?"</p>

<p>"How do you know there is anything to
make straight?"</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said Sylvia, with quiet scorn.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sylvia!" said Pamela, "you don't understand.
I am tired of love and lovers. I only
want to be let alone. I have suffered too much."</p>

<p>"If you have, it's your own fault. You'd
no business to take poor dear Glengall when
you were in love with someone else, though
how you could look at others in the same
day with Glengall fairly bothers me. And
now, why don't you write and ask Anthony
Trevithick to come back?"</p>

<p>"I don't want him to come back."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do; you're crying your eyes out
for him every night. Yes, you are. And why
you let all this muddle go on without doing
anything to prevent it I don't know. I could
shake you, Pam!"</p>

<p>"What would you have done, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"Well, supposing I was in love with a man
and knew him to be in love with me, and
supposing he went away and didn't write, I'd
never think anything except that the letter
was lost. If I could get at him, I'd write and
ask him what it meant. If I couldn't, I'd go
on believing in him, maybe till I was old and
grey, and till I died, as some have done&mdash;if I
really loved him, mind you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about it, Madam Faint-Heart."</p>

<p>"But come," she said, after a benevolent
scrutiny of Pamela; "come, you look very
nice, unless you'd like to put on the pink
sun-bonnet. Anthony Trevithick is in the
drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Sylvia!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know I ought to have mentioned
it before, instead of talking nonsense. The
poor young man's on tenter-hooks."</p>

<p>"Sylvia! I <em>can't</em> go down."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can. You shall, even if I have
to use force."</p>

<p>"Very well, Sylvia," said Pam, rising and
trembling a little.</p>

<p>"Come, don't think about it. Do it quickly,
as we used to take our cod-liver oil long ago.
Let us run down the stairs. There, you poor
little thing! your hands are cold. The run
will warm them."</p>

<p>And, half-resisting, Pamela was pulled by
force down the stairs.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she entered the room with her
head high.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Sir Anthony?" she began.</p>

<p>"Ah, Pam darling!" cried the young man,
coming to meet her. "Don't give me any
more cold words or cold looks. I haven't
deserved them, and if you've nothing else for
me I shall go away for ever."</p>

<p>"No, surely," said Pam, and her sweet voice
had a little surprise in it. "You didn't really
deserve any blame at all."</p>

<p>"But you did, for I asked you to trust me,
Pam. I asked you to trust me, and your faith
was brittle."</p>

<p>"So it was," said Pam.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sylvia, as she went out and
closed the door. "It is plain these recriminations
are not meant for me. Heigho! I wish
Mr. Baker would come along just now, that
I might have the satisfaction of refusing him.
It is easy to see that Glengall is as completely
forgotten as if he had never existed."</p>

<p>No one could say that Mr. Graydon's youngest
daughter was not loyal to the absent.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>A PROPOSAL.</h3>


<p>Pamela Graydon had been Pamela
Trevithick for three years, when one
day in late summer Sylvia, still Sylvia
Graydon, was entertaining a visitor
in her London drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was Lord Glengall, a shade greyer, a
shade leaner, but looking well nevertheless,
and brown with southern suns.</p>

<p>"And so," he said, "we shall travel back to
Ireland together."</p>

<p>"It will be a delightful and unexpected
pleasure to have your company."</p>

<p>"You are glad to return, Sylvia?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>"Glad! It is no word for it. I am hungry
for the velvety wind that blows across the
mountains. I am so tired of these glaring
streets, of parties, and dinners and luncheons,
and functions of all kinds."</p>

<p>Lord Glengall laughed.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, I am amazed and
amused to find your father in the midst of
it all."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus068.jpg" width="450" height="469" alt="resisting" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Half-resisting, Pamela was pulled by force.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Papa! Oh, papa is the veriest Piccadilly
lounger. He has returned to it all as freshly
as if he had never left it. He discovered
troops of old friends&mdash;without a misgiving&mdash;as
soon as ever he came in for the title."</p>

<p>"He doesn't pine for Carrickmoyle?"</p>

<p>"Now and again. When the desire becomes
very strong, he and I slip away to Euston
some evening, forgetting all our engagements,
and, for a few days, our new circumstances,
at Carrickmoyle, where Bridget cooks our
chops and makes us potato-cakes just as
of old."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear Bridget is still to the fore."</p>

<p>"She is not a day older."</p>

<p>"She never carried out her threat of marrying
my gardener?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Grady is still a widdy-man, as they
used to say in the dear country."</p>

<p>"But to return to your father. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">magnum
opus</i> has become an accomplished fact. You
see, I haven't been so far out of the world as
not to have heard that."</p>

<p>"Yes. It has been a great success. He is
as much in request at learned societies and
conversaziones as he is in fashionable drawing-rooms.
To think of the years he vegetated
at Carrickmoyle!"</p>

<p>"Happy years, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"I could hardly hope for happier."</p>

<p>"He will be in soon, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"About half-past five," consulting a little
watch fastened to her gown. "You can endure
my company till then."</p>

<p>"I shall try to. But am I not keeping you
from afternoon calls or something? I saw a
carriage at the door as I came in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have sent it away. I was rejoiced to do
it. Papa will be simply wild with delight
at your falling from the clouds like this."</p>

<p>"He hasn't forgotten me, then?"</p>

<p>"How should he? The only drawback about
Carrickmoyle has been that we could see from
it the cold chimneys of Glengall."</p>

<p>"Ah! we shall warm them," said Lord
Glengall, beaming at her. "We shall have
fine jinks if only you and your father will
spend six months of the year at Carrickmoyle.
I am no Londoner, and never shall be. But
I shall be able to endure six months of solitude
if I know I am going to have you for the
remainder of the year."</p>

<p>"You will not long be left solitary. You
cheated the country the last time by disappearing
again before it had had time to
rejoice over you. Your return will flutter
the dovecotes for thirty miles around."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Sylvia," said Lord
Glengall simply. "But you have not told
me half the news," he went on. "How
is Molly?"</p>

<p>"Flourishing. Mick has got his company.
He wouldn't leave the service on any consideration,
and I think he was right. They
are as much in love with each other as ever;
and they have a beautiful boy."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is right. Molly deserved to be
happy."</p>

<p>"She did, and so did Mick. Mick is a dear
old fellow."</p>

<p>"And Pam, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>There was no consciousness in his voice.</p>

<p>"Pam, too, is a success. She has been a
beauty for three seasons, strange to say."</p>

<p>"And it is a happy marriage?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly happy. They are ideally well
suited."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that. How does Pam get on
with her mother-in-law?"</p>

<p>"Fairly well, I believe. Lady Jane keeps
herself to herself, which is lucky for Pam.
I never took to that lady. But she is devoted
to the heir. She wouldn't strike you,
somehow, as a grandmotherly person, but it
is so."</p>

<p>"There is an heir?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is two years old, and he has a
baby sister of seven months."</p>

<p>"Ah! how you young people have been
making history since I left. I shall not know
this new world of your making."</p>

<p>"You find me changed?"</p>

<p>"Lovelier, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"It is nice to have you say that."</p>

<p>"Still greedy for conquest, even though it
is only an old fogey?"</p>

<p>"Ah!"&mdash;with more intensity than he thought
the occasion demanded&mdash;"you never can be
that!"</p>

<p>"You are always kind, little girl. When I
look into your eyes, I fancy it is the old
Sylvia I am talking to, and not a fine lady."</p>

<p>"It is the old Sylvia."</p>

<p>"The Sylvia I knew would never have worn
this"&mdash;touching a fold of her dress.</p>

<p>"She would, if she could. It is only a
Paris tea-gown. She was happier in the
prints at sixpence a yard from Guirk's shop
in Lettergort."</p>

<p>"Happier, Sylvia? What have you been
doing with yourself since?"</p>

<p>"Growing old and faded with trying to
occupy several houses at once and doing a
great many things I detest."</p>

<p>She laughed at him from where she sat in
her youth and beauty, and he laughed in
answer.</p>

<p>"Where are the lads who used to be in
love with you?"</p>

<p>"All married, except Algy St. Quintin;
but he has long given up asking me. We
are good comrades."</p>

<p>"No more than that, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"No more than that. I wouldn't lose sight
of him for anything. He is just the same
imp of mischief, as Bridget used to call him.
His coolness is phenomenal, and his impudence
so deliciously incongruous with his cherubic
boy's face."</p>

<p>"There is no one else, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"There is no one else."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are so hard-hearted, child. Or is
it that you will stay with your father?"</p>

<p>"Not altogether that. I've seen no one
here I would marry."</p>

<p>"Yet you have met all sorts and conditions
of men."</p>

<p>"All sorts and conditions, but not the right
one."</p>

<p>"The right one will come."</p>

<p>"He might come&mdash;he may have come,
and not have found me the right woman."</p>

<p>She looked at him an instant; then she
suddenly blushed hotly, and her eyes fell and
rested on the jewelled fingers in her lap. So
full was her attitude of yielding and submission
that it might well make the heart of
a lover leap.</p>

<p>A sudden, bewildering idea came to the
man before her. For an instant he was
dazed with the shock of it. Then he stood
up and paced the room in great agitation.</p>

<p>"Sylvia," he said at last, pausing before
her where she still sat, a lovely image of
submission, "Pamela was right when she did
not marry me."</p>

<p>"She was right because she did not love you."</p>

<p>"How could she love me? I might have
been her father."</p>

<p>"That is no reason. Love does not take
count of such things."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sylvia! What has love to do with
grey hairs?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<p>"If there is love, they are better than gold."</p>

<p>"Sylvia, do you know what madness you
are putting into my head?"</p>

<p>"I cannot know unless you tell me."</p>

<p>Sylvia's eyes were raised to his with a
flash of the old audacity.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I dare not tell you."</p>

<p>"Ah, do!"</p>

<p>"If I were a young man and you would
do it, you might turn this work-a-day earth
to Paradise for me."</p>

<p>"And why not now?"</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">He made a step towards her.&mdash;<em>p. 552.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>"Ah! child, you do not know what you
are saying. What could you, a beauty and
an heiress, see in me?"</p>

<p>"I am glad I am beautiful to you. But
why should that and the other things stand
between me and my happiness?"</p>

<p>"Your happiness, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! You wouldn't see it, but I
always thought there was no one in the
world like you. You chose Pam before me,
and even then I accepted your will, but
I loved you still."</p>

<p>"I chose Pam because she was unhappy,
because there seemed no other way. It did
not break my heart to give her up, though
it was a blow. It does not hurt me now
to hear of her as Lady Trevithick. But I
dare not risk the same thing with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it would be so easy to forget
my years, and love you with a young man's
ardour, and more than a young man's faith."</p>

<p>"Then why not love me?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Sylvia, it is your kindness, your
compassion. I could not endure to be thrown
over now, even though I am well on in my
forties."</p>

<p>"I shall not throw you over. Look at me,
and you will see."</p>

<p>He looked at her, and made a step towards
her.</p>

<p>"Then you will make the world over again
for me?"</p>

<p>"And you for me?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Sylvia!"</p>

<p>"Yes. How hard it was to persuade you.
There will be lots of people who will want to
marry you once it is known you have come
back. You might have liked someone better
than me. And I have waited for three years."</p>

<p>"You fairy princess, what do you mean
by condescending to a mortal's grey hairs?"</p>

<p>"We shall be so happy, you and I and
papa. We shall lead the country life, though
he'll have to come to London now and again
for his serious 'frivolities.' And I shall make
you care for me. Now you do not care for
me nearly so much as I do for you."</p>

<p>"You bewilder me, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, you will care for me. I shall
not let you cheat me."</p>

<p>"You talk as if my youth were not flown,
you lovely child."</p>

<p>"It is not flown. You do not mean to
say you used up your youth during those
hard years that lined your face and sowed
grey hairs in your head? Ah! no, you were
saving it up for me."</p>

<p>"It is <em>too</em> incredible!"</p>

<p>"Take time, then, to think, good gentleman,"
said Sylvia, with laughter dancing
bewitchingly about her mouth; but her eyes
were tender.</p>

<p>"If I take time, all this will take wings
like a dream and fly away."</p>

<p>"Then keep it," said Sylvia.</p>

<p>"My life&mdash;what remains of it&mdash;will be
devoted to you."</p>

<p>"It is time you should say that. You
have been going after false fires, while I
have been true all the time."</p>

<p>"You to me, Sylvia!"</p>

<p>"I to you. But if I had not almost asked
you, you would have left me to single
blessedness. Ah! there is papa's ring. He
will be glad."</p>

<p>"He will think it folly, Sylvia."</p>

<p>"Ah! no, he won't. Dear, wise papa, he
was always anxious for you to marry one
of his daughters."</p>

<h3><em>A VISIT TO THE EARLSWOOD ASYLUM.</em></h3>

<p class="center">(<em>Illustrated from Photographs by Cassell and Co., Ltd.</em>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">[<em>This is the first of a special series of illustrated articles
on representative philanthropic institutions. Each
article will describe the scope and work of the institution
concerned, and will in addition contain
detailed information as to the methods of admission,
with special reference to the "voting" system.</em>]</p></blockquote>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus072a.jpg" alt="I" width="60" height="113" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">The young Queen Victoria
had been ten years
on the throne of England.
In this decade
the wheel of philanthropy
seemed to
turn with increased
impetus. It had been
set in motion before
the dawn of the nineteenth
century, for then asylums for the
blind, the deaf and dumb, and lunatic
had been established. Now various institutions
and schemes of benevolence were
springing into existence in aid of other
classes of sufferers. There was still
something wanting, a lady maintained
to Dr. Andrew Reed&mdash;a powerful friend
of the afflicted and needy; she asked
him to help the feeble-minded. He
demurred; he doubted whether there
were sufficient cases to call for a special
institute. If she could find six in six
days, he promised to take up the matter.
Six days produced twenty eligible from
their poverty and infirmity, and the
well-known philanthropist kept his word.
The National Asylum for Idiots was
inaugurated at the Mansion House in
October, 1847, and was established at
Highgate in January, 1848. Since then
it has received upwards of 3,000 cases,
and the institution now at Earlswood
has served as a model for others in
different parts of Europe and our
colonies.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus072.jpg" width="450" height="262" alt="printing" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">IN THE PRINTING OFFICE AT EARLSWOOD.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The need of such asylums encircles
the world; for wherever humanity has
spread children may be born with
inherent infirmity, or the "heart ache
and a thousand natural shocks which
flesh is heir to" may cloud the brightest
intelligence. The poor and sick in mind
must ever appeal for help to the rich
and strong and capable. The mysterious
"something wanting" in intellect
is a grievous calamity, even when good
friends and wealth can procure all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
possible compensations. In a family
where the necessities of life depend on
the power to work, it reduces existence
to a miserable burden. It was
especially for the poor that the National
Asylum was established. The pleasant
building standing on the breezy uplands
above Redhill can accommodate nearly
700 patients; and twice a year, on the
last Thursday in the months of April
and October, needy cases, from five
years old and upwards, are elected on
the foundation by the votes of subscribers.
There are generally from 130
to 150 applicants, though funds only
allow the admission of about one-fifth
of the number. Presentations for life
may be secured, but it is a happiness
to know that the term of five years,
which is the rule in election, is sometimes
sufficient to teach a boy a trade,
or a girl to make herself useful in
housework, needlework, or a laundry.
Patients entered for five years may be
re-elected. Lately one of them wrote
to his friends, "It will be soon time to
get me in again for another five years.
I hope that it will be all right; I like
Earlswood."</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A VIEW OF THE DINING HALL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Why should a boy able to write
and to take thought for his own affairs
be in an asylum for imbeciles? A visit
to Earlswood would be the most effectual
answer to the question. It is hard to
know where idiocy begins and ends.
There are skilled workmen in the
printers', tailors', carpenters', and other
departments, who, to a casual observer,
betray nothing wanting.</p>

<p>Many of their exhibits, as well as
specimens of the girls' and women's
needlework, were sold at the Arts and
Crafts Exhibition at Lancaster in 1897,
where a section was open to institutions
for imbeciles, and seventeen prizes were
awarded to Earlswood. But there are
other patients whose limited intelligence
renders them oblivious of their own
infirmity or their own names; between
the two extremes there is every degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
of feebleness of mind. Those who consciously
suffer least are likely to call
out the greatest compassion. It is
natural to turn away and try to forget
the sight of a human creature going
on all-fours, or of great helpless babies,
without the charm or sweetness of
infancy, sitting up with bibs on, waiting
for the meal
for which they
cannot ask.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus074.jpg" width="250" height="342" alt="workshop" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">IN HIS OWN WORKSHOP.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"It must be
sad and painful
to a visitor," the
matron said, "to
have a passing
glance at the
worst cases, but
to live amongst
them, as she had
done for eleven
years, was full
of interest.
Nearly all were
capable of some
improvement."</p>

<p>A home where
everything is
done to promote
their health and
happiness is, for the weak-minded, a new
world. To be taken from conditions of
continual disadvantage, and placed under
the charge of guardians whose first duty
is to work and watch for the awakening
of soul and mind, brings hope and
comfort into their life. A poor constitution
is often added to the disadvantages
of the imbecile; and in families
where their friends cannot constantly
protect them they are often exposed to
teasing, and driven into fits of fury,
ending in chronic bad temper, by the
mischief or malice of their companions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus074a.jpg" width="350" height="276" alt="asylum" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A VIEW OF THE ASYLUM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"No one is allowed to tease them
here," a nurse remarked, in speaking of
the patients' affection and their general
disposition to get on well together.
They are classified, so that they meet
companions on equal terms. The lowest
have not the spirit or independence to
defy lawful authority; to the highest
but refractory, degradation to a class
below is the most salutary punishment that
can be inflicted. They soon try by their
conduct to rise to their former level.
Anyone in charge giving a patient a
blow would be liable to criminal prosecution.
The vicious or dangerous cases
are not admitted, and the authorities
do not encourage the re-election of those
who give absolutely no promise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
improvement. The vacancies ought to be
filled by candidates to whom care and
treatment will be of use. In the great
busy world outside Earlswood are
muscular limbs dwindling or growing
stiff for want of exercise, and hands
framed for skill which are only filled
with mischief by the active spirit
against whom Dr. Watts left an immortal
warning. They need not remain idle,
for special training can supply much
that Nature has denied.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus075.jpg" width="250" height="276" alt="school" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">AT SCHOOL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It requires a great deal of patience
to teach this class of pupils a useful
calling, as more than one instructor
remarked when the doctor conducted a
visitor through the various workshops.
Some are unwilling to learn; in Earlswood,
as in all communities, each variety
of disposition is represented, as well as
every degree of lack of ability.</p>

<p>"You can't make me work, you know,
doctor," one patient maintained, "for
I am only an imbecile."</p>

<p>Happily, in this little world which, in
spite of its limitations, manufactures and
supplies for itself most of the necessaries
of life, all are not ready to make capital
out of their infirmity. The master-carpenter
lamented the loss of a former
diligent pupil, who had been worth one
pound a week to the institution, and
he showed with pride the doors and
panels of another, who he said might
now earn his own living anywhere.
This clever young carpenter had been
at Earlswood for three years, and in
the workshop for two. He bore a high
character, and was so attached to the
asylum that, when he was at home for
a summer holiday, he came back for a
day. Yet before his admission his relations
had been unable to manage him.</p>

<p>The master-tailor called one of his
"best boys" to show the waistcoat he
was making. A good-looking middle-aged
man descended with alacrity from
the table&mdash;where, in the time-honoured
custom of his trade, he worked in an
attitude calculated to cause persons of
other callings violent cramp in the legs&mdash;and
shook hands all round with great
warmth and friendliness. Directly he
had displayed a piece of work, in which
his instructor took pardonable pride,
he returned with renewed diligence to
his needle and thread. This man's
interest in tailoring is so keen that
when he, in his turn, does duty in the
kitchen, he returns to his cloth and
his favourite attitude for every available
moment. Seated together with the
first-class workmen are others, smiling
over their attempts to learn stitching
or to make button-holes. They may
possibly never get beyond samplers, but
time will show.</p>

<p>In the shoemakers' shop similar
degrees of skill and industry were
manifest. One man held in his hand a
finished boot that he had made from
the beginning, whilst others could only
be trusted to black and polish. So it
was with the rest of the twenty-five
trades and callings in which last year
198 men and boys were employed, each
according to his several ability. Perhaps
the highest attainments are seen
in the printing department&mdash;the only
one that undertakes outside work. Besides
the necessary printing for Earlswood
and the London office, 232 private
orders were sent out last year, and a
profit was made of £150. On the occasion
of my visit, a young compositor
was not quite ready to show his proof
to the doctor, who inquired what he
was doing. He had just set up the
programme for a patients' party, and
had made it conclude with "Musicle
Chairs"; he wanted to correct the
spelling before it was inspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span></p>

<p>One elderly man, deaf, with an impediment
in his speech and afflicted in mind,
had his own workshop. All around him
were evidences of his artistic skill. He
looked tenderly at his own drawings, but
the objects of his special admiration were
the various magnifiers and reflectors he
had designed and made to help him
in fine carving. H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales, who is interested in Earlswood,
has lately presented him with some
elephant tusks. It was a pleasure to
this artist to display the lightness of an
ivory landscape brooch. A piece of
tortoise-shell at the back, with a judicious
arrangement of the golden and
dark blotches, made it a transparency.
When held up on one side to the light,
it was a sunny scene; whilst on the other
it was dark, with a full moon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus076.jpg" width="450" height="359" alt="kitchen" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A CORNER OF THE KITCHEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In spite of gentle manners and artistic
skill, this man would probably be unable
to live or turn his talents to account outside
an asylum. He belongs to a class
who for practical purposes never outgrow
mental childhood. Years roll by.
Time brings them grey hairs and other
signs of his flight, but never carries
them beyond the need of fatherly care.
Many with far less intelligence seem to
realise this.</p>

<p>It is pathetic to hear in some wards
the cry of "Mother!" and see a smile of
fancied recognition when a stranger
appears. One middle-aged woman who
called out "Mamma, mamma!" had
some information, cheerful but incoherent,
to impart. Then the name of
"George" suddenly arrested her flow
of trivialities, and her face puckered
into a grotesque expression of distress.
She raised her hand and pointed upward,
saying, "George up there." The sorrowful
remembrance was, however, transient;
the next instant she was all smiles. The
eddy on the surface of her smooth life
soon caught the sunshine, but its presence
was sufficient to call out fresh compassion
for the poor souls whose wits may have
been lost under a weight of trouble
heavier than they could bear.</p>

<p>The sad pages in the life-history of
some of the most helpless are, however,
blotted out of their memory, or only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
dimly recalled by a fragmentary remark.
The sound of laughter in the recreation-room,
sitting-rooms, and playground is
almost constant. If it shows the vacant
mind, it also bespeaks content. Pleasure
and enjoyment are circumscribed, but
so also is the capacity for suffering in
mind and body. The patients have
almost as little temptation to anxious
thought for the morrow as the ravens
or lilies.</p>

<p>In a narrow sphere a trifling event
assumes great dimensions, and the day
may be easily filled with pleasures. The
delight with which one middle-aged
patient said that she was going to have
a new dress had all the innocent glee of
childhood. A lad who called out "Tick,
tick!" at the sight of the doctor was
immediately made happy by being allowed
to listen to his watch.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus077.jpg" width="450" height="259" alt="drill" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE CHILDREN AT DRILL IN THE RECREATION-ROOM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Various little treats are planned as rewards
for good conduct. In the winter,
those who do well are invited once a
week to join in games in the recreation-room.
Yet the Head Governess is of
opinion that the little ones are never
happier than when they are at lessons.
According to their ability, they go
through the course usually adopted in
elementary schools, and have the same
physical exercises. The elder girls are
employed in housework or in the
laundry. Many, no doubt, enjoy the
new experience of being usefully employed,
and industry and willingness are
rewarded by an afternoon walk to the
town, a small amount of pocket-money,
and a reward at the New Year.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus078.jpg" width="350" height="243" alt="mat" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Mat-Making</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sense of right and wrong, and of
responsibility, develops with exercise. Of
the many letters received last year at
Earlswood from the patients or their
relations acknowledging the good results
of training, the Resident Physician looked
upon one from a man discharged five
years ago as the most satisfactory. But
for a course of treatment the writer
would probably have remained all his
life as a burden on his relations. He is
now earning ten shillings a week in a
grocery business. After making this
satisfactory announcement, he continues:
"I belong to a Bible-class. I am also in
a club, so, if I am ill, my mother gets ten
shillings and sixpence per week, and my
doctor's bill paid." With inquiries after
old friends, special love to two, this
patient remains a "loving friend." How
many men with all their faculties do
more? And how many others fall below
his standard of duty and gratitude! In
days of old, one out of ten to whom the
same miracle of mercy brought new life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
and health returned
to the great Healer
and gave glory to
God, and he belonged
to a class from whom
least might have been
expected. A good
proportion of the
strangers to many
privileges, as the
feeble-minded must
ever remain, often live
as examples of doing
their best. A man is
accepted according to
that he hath.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus078a.jpg" width="350" height="251" alt="basket" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SOME BASKET-WORKERS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The highest and the
only certain principle
of good conduct is
kept before all who
enter the asylum.
Twice a day they
meet for prayers, and before and after
meals grace, sung in the great hall to
the accompaniment of a fine organ,
fills the corridors with music, in which
many of the patients delight. The
resident Religious Instructor last year
found a note slipped into his hand,
addressed, "Mr. Small, from me." A
patient wrote:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>, I wish to ask you, in a
nice kind way or other, to have two
of my hymns on the 5th of February,
which is Saturday. Please have them
in the evening&mdash;Nos. 500 and 532&mdash;and
you may quite expect a nice pocket-book
from me.&mdash;Your friend, <span class="smcap">Percy</span>."</p>

<p>It is not unusual for boys to ask
that their birthdays may be celebrated
by singing their favourite hymns.</p>

<p>Their teacher finds that lessons on
the life and miracles of our Lord always
have a charm for the patients. Even
those unable to read or intelligently
follow the prayers can enjoy Sunday;
then they receive pictures illustrating
Bible incidents, and can, at least, hear
the hymns at the evening service, which
in summer is held under the trees.
Methods of teaching
must be adapted to
the varied capacity,
but the lesson of the
compassion of our
Lord for every infirmity
is common to
the 600 patients whom
Earlswood now shelters,
whilst 130 are
waiting for admission.</p>

<p>One class may enter
by payment, which
varies according to
the circumstances and
requirements. The
lowest payment is
sixty-five guineas a
year, and it includes
entire maintenance
and clothing for
twelve months. There
are no vacations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
unless the friends desire it. Private
patients do not mix with those on the
foundation either at meals or in the
recreation-room. Some have their own
sitting-rooms and special attendants.</p>

<p>Another class of patients may enter
by part-payment. They are elected
from a list of candidates whose friends
fill a position that would preclude their
gaining free admission, but who are
unable to make the ordinary payment.
The minimum sum of fifteen guineas is
required annually so long as the child
remains in the asylum.</p>

<p>A large number of subscribers' votes,
700 at least, are required to place a
candidate for ordinary election on the
foundation. Before canvassing, a form
must be obtained from the office, 36,
King William Street, London Bridge,
E.C., in order to see if the case is
deemed eligible by the Board, whether
for free or part-payment election. For
the well-being of the community in
general, rules cannot be broken. Great
disappointment and trouble are sometimes
occasioned by an attempt to
canvass before ascertaining that a candidate
will be approved by the Board.
The receipt of parish relief at any time
disqualifies a candidate. Certain regulations,
the result of experience, have
been made regarding receiving and maintaining
the large family whom the
authorities have taken under their care,

<p>During fifty years the supporters of
this institution have, in a very literal
sense, obeyed the injunction to "comfort
the feeble-minded." In spite of limp
limbs and slouching gait, the weakest
among the imbecile bear the image of
their Creator. Can it be doubted that
they are as precious to Him as the
conies who, though "but a feeble folk,"
find, under His providence, a refuge in
the stony rocks? In their helplessness
and dependence, the afflicted in mind
find a place in the heart and affection
of their guardians; and who can tell
how many have learnt, through them,
to hide themselves with all their infirmities
in the Rock of Ages?</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Mother-hood</span></h2>

<p class="center">By Lina Orman Cooper, Author of "Our Home Rulers," Etc.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus080a.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="120" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">There is many an
arrow in my
quiver, full of
speech to the
wise, but for
the many they need
interpreters."</p>
</div>

<p>So wrote Pindar
long, long ago; and
I, having gathered
many arrows of help
and knowledge from
the quiver of books
around me, would fain
pass them on. In this
paper I string these
barbs to the bow of
motherhood, and trust they may pierce to
the joints of the harness.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no subject absorbing more
attention at the present time than that of
motherhood and heredity. Never has the
cult of maternity been better formulated&mdash;never
has the practice of it been more carefully
studied. "In these days of pressure,"
writes Lyttleton, "it is a mother's first duty
to her children to secure for them a full seven
years of passive life." "The best and first
service a mother can do her children," says
another writer, "is to maintain the standard
of her own life at its highest&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"'Allure to brighter worlds, and <em>lead the way</em>.'"<br />
</p>

<p>"It is a mother's first duty to provide for
each newborn soul an environment which
will foster its highest development," says
another. "To praise is a part of a mother's
first work in the world on behalf of her
children," adds a fourth. "I consider it to
be the first and most important part of the
education of childhood to lead them early to
think" is Froebel's opinion.</p>

<p>The importance of a mother's influence
during the first few years of existence is
repeated in Lord Macaulay's well-known
aphorism, "Give me the first seven years
of a child's life, and let who will take the
rest"; and by Froebel, when he says, "The
most important period of human education is
before the child is seven years old."</p>

<p>We mothers, who are God's special servants&mdash;His
instruments, as it were, for the particular
purpose of carrying out His will for the wee
individuals confided to us&mdash;are apt to think
too little about those first years of a child's
life. Our children, from two to five, are
often left to self-education. Very little
scientific care is expended on them. Yet
beauty of body and soul would not be so
seldom met with, or so transient as it is
apt to be with us, if we truly educated
persons took our children in hand from their
<em>babyhood</em>, instead of leaving them to the
most ignorant class of the community.</p>

<p>"It is usual to speak of the Greeks," writes
Peabody in his "Primary School," "as if
they were of exceptional organisation. Their
organisation was only exceptional because
it was more carefully treated in <em>infancy</em> than
ours is apt to be."</p>

<p>"The laws which govern the growth of the
human mind are as definite and as general
in their application as those which apply to
the material universe," and we know the
basis of all development is a <em>good foundation</em>.
This must be laid in early youth, both as
regards the body and as regards the mind.
"It is so fatally easy to do mischief" in
those first seven years. The limbs of a
sapling are not more easily bent than the
budding desires of the infant. "The soul
instinctively expects love" from the first, and
only a mother's exclusively cherishing tenderness
ought to be the rule in a nursery.
"The true educational instinct is but the
mother's instinct and method clearly understood
in all its bearings and carried out
intelligently."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p>This last word opens out a wonderful vista.
"Parents should make the care of their
children an object to study physiology and
psychology," says Peabody; and thus we find
education is always mutual. According to
Goethe, "the child teaches the parent what
the parents omit to teach him"; and, as
Plato adds, "man cannot propose (or woman
either) a higher or loftier object for his
study than education and all that pertains
thereto."</p>

<p>Before leaving this branch of the subject,
it is well for all mothers clearly to understand
the difference between education and
instruction. The former (training of the
heart) belongs exclusively to the parent.
The latter (training of the intellect) to the
governess. As Renan puts it, "Instruction
is given in the school. Education takes place
in the father's house; the masters are the
mothers and sisters."</p>

<p>Well for us if we remember that education
is always going on, whether we will it or
not. Our life, our morals, are affecting our
children for weal or woe, whether we realise
or shirk the fact. "Every human life is
lifted or lowered by the home it is born
into." That magic and omnipotent gift of a
mother's influence "is an hourly, unconscious,
emanating force" exercised on those around.
"We always know when we are instructing.
We do not always know when we are
educating." The realisation of this amazing
power is enough to stagger the bravest
heart. "A mother has to be convinced
that the great function of motherhood is not
only to guard her child, to exhort him, to
train him, but to live her life in the presence
of that child as a pattern of what the child
should aspire to become."</p>

<p>A mother's influence should certainly be at
its strongest during the early years of life.
It "depends on what she is, and only in a
subordinate way on what she does." Therefore,
she can carry altruism too far. A
mother is of as much value in the sight of
God as is her child, and "the path in which
she has to walk is plainly that of self-sanctification
for the sake of" that child.
This implies seasons for culture, rest, prayer,
and the preservation of her body in health.
To quote Miss Mason on this point, "Health
is a duty, and any trifling with health,
either vicious or careless, is really in the
nature of suicide, because life is held in trust
from a supreme Authority."</p>

<p>Will the years be wasted if we spend
them mastering the science of education in
our nurseries? Nay! even our personal
charms will be amplified by the most
entrancing study in the world. "The perfect
loveliness of a woman's countenance can
only consist in that majestic peace which is
founded in memory of happy and useful
years full of sweet records" (Ruskin). Verily
we shall have our reward.</p>

<h2>The Ten Little Indians</h2>

<h3>A FAIRY PARABLE.</h3>

<p class="center">By Howard Angus Kennedy.</p>

                    <div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus082a.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="98" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">Once upon a time there
were ten little Red
Indians, and they lived
in a school-house built
of logs on the banks
of the River Saskatchewan;
and, if you cannot
pronounce the river's
name, just try till you
can. The reason they
lived in a school-house was that their fathers
had gone hunting in the woods, and their
mothers were dead, so the wigwams were
very lonely; but the children were as happy
as they could be, and enjoyed their schooling
as much as any white children enjoy their
holidays. The teacher was a sweet white
lady from down beyond, who mothered them
all so well that they never even thought of
being bad. At least, only two of them did;
and they never got beyond thinking about
it, as long as the teacher was with them.</p>
</div>

<p>Down at the bottom of the river, in a deep,
deep hole, there lived a wicked wizard; and one
morning very early he was prowling along by
the shore, with just the tip of his nose above
water, sniff-sniff-sniffing for the scent of
anyone good to eat. Now it happened that
that morning the teacher had got up very
early, and was sitting on a stone by the riverside,
trying to think of new story-lessons to
tell the children; and the wizard put up his
long snaky arm out of the water and caught
her by the neck and dragged her down to his
cave. Then he tied her hands and feet, and
waited for her to drown; but drown she would
not. So he thought she must have a Testament
in her pocket to act as a charm. The
Testament was really in her heart, which was
a great deal better. So when he saw she
would not drown, he was a little frightened,
and offered to let her go if she would give him
one of the children instead.</p>

<p>"You wicked wizard," said she, "not one of
them shall you have!"</p>

<p>"We shall see about that," said the wizard;
and out he went, leaving the teacher tied fast
at the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>Now, when the children came down, they
were very much surprised to find no teacher;
but they took their morning dip in the river,
as she had taught them to do. Just as they
were coming out to dry themselves, a great
grey fish put his head out of the water and
said&mdash;"Children, the wizard that lives in the
hole has caught your teacher, and he's coming
to catch you."</p>

<p>The children jumped out of the water in a
great fright. "What shall we do? What
<em>shall</em> we do?" they all began to cry.</p>

<p>"Put on your clothes," said the fish, after he
had gone down for a moment to breathe.</p>

<p>That was soon done, for they had very few
clothes to put on.</p>

<p>"Now get on our backs," said the great grey
fish, who had come up this time with nine
others as like him as could be. Then the ten
fishes humped up their great grey backs, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
keeping their heads under water to breathe
with and their tails to swim with; and the ten
children got on, and the fishes carried them
across the big river in a twinkling.</p>

<p>"Now, children," said the chief of the fishes,
"strike into the wood as straight as you can
go till you come to the old brown bear, and
he'll tell you the way to Fruity Hollow,
where you'll get your dinner; but don't
speak to the grizzly bear, for he's the
wizard's son. Then go on till you come to the
old grey wolf, and she'll tell you the way to
the otters' cave; but don't say a word to the
red wolf with the squint, for she's the wizard's
daughter."</p>

<p>The fish was quite out of breath when he
got to the end of this speech, and disappeared
in a hurry.</p>

<p>Then the ten little Indians marched off into
the woods, Indian file; and they all kept close
together, one behind the other, except the two
little boys that sometimes wished they did not
have to do what they ought; and they dawdled
behind. Pretty soon the children got to where
the poplars end and the pinewoods begin, and
there they saw the grizzly bear sitting on his
haunches beside the path, with his arms folded
smugly across his chest and his cruel face
trying to smile.</p>

<p>"Welcome, little darlings!" the grizzly bear
said, in a voice as sweet as honey. "Would
you like me to take you to Fruity Hollow?"</p>

<p>The children shut their mouths tightly, and
went straight on, and the grizzly gritted his
teeth in disappointment; but when the two
bad little Indians came straggling along he sat
up again and put on his smirkiest smile and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You poor little dears! What a shame it
was for the others to leave you behind! How
hungry you must be! Would you like me to
show you the way to Fruity Hollow?"</p>

<p>"That I should, indeed!" said one of the
boys. And the grizzly bear sprang upon him,
and caught him up, and hugged him till the
breath was nearly out of his body, and strode
off with him; and the other boy ran on as fast
as he could to catch up his companions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the eight little Indians marched
steadily on till they came to the old brown
bear; and he was so fast asleep they could only
wake him by pulling his fur, but they took care
to pull it respectfully.</p>

<p>"All right," said the old brown bear in a
mumbly voice, "I know what you want.
First turning on the right, over the big tree
that blew down last winter." Then he went
to sleep again before they could say "Thank
you, sir."</p>

<p>When they came to a big tree lying with its
roots in the air, but with its needles still
green, they scrambled over it and followed a
winding path down into a narrow valley just
full of wild raspberry- and gooseberry- and
currant-bushes, and they picked and ate and
picked and ate till they could eat no more.
Then they made baskets of big leaves and
twigs, and filled them with berries for supper,
and climbed back over the big tree and trudged
along up the path.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards they came upon the squinting
red wolf, straddling right across the track.</p>

<p>"Here we are, you sweet little redskins,"
said she, with a grin two feet long. "The
otters have asked me to show you the way to
their cave."</p>

<p>The little redskins turned almost white with
fear, but they shut their mouths tightly and
pushed right on, and the wicked red wolf had
to jump out of the way in a hurry, for she
did not dare to touch children who remembered
and obeyed. Presently the dawdler came up,
very hungry and tired&mdash;for the brown bear
had been much too fast asleep to tell him
about Fruity Hollow&mdash;and burst out at once,
without thinking, "Please can you tell me the
way to the otters' cave?" Then the red wolf
leapt upon him, and knocked him down, and
picked him up by the back of his clothes and
carried him off at a trot through the scratching
brambles.</p>

<p>Just where the pinewoods end and the
poplars begin again, the eight little Indians
came upon the old grey wolf, curled up with
her nose on her tail; and she put up her head
for the children to scratch her neck. "Across
the meadow and round the slough," she said
when she had been scratched enough; "and
down the stony creek."</p>

<p>So when they got to the edge of the wood
they struck right across the meadow, wading
knee-deep in the long rich grass; and then
they found a path leading through another
patch of poplar wood to a wide green slough&mdash;or
"sloo," as they call it in Canada&mdash;half-lake
and half-swamp; and they trod lightly
round the narrow edge till they found the
place where the water oozed out into the
creek. Down the creek they went, with the
stream purring beside their feet like a kitten
in the sun, and the mosquitoes humming over
their heads, and the silly loose-leaved poplars
rustling all around them, wind or no wind.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said the biggest little Indian.
And through all the purring and humming and
rustling came the long low swishing sound
of a big river. Then the eight little pairs of
feet climbed out of the creek-bed, and crossed
a corner of land till they stood almost on the
edge of the river's earthen-cut bank.</p>

<p>There was a bustling and a scurrying under
foot, and then a row of furry brown little
heads popped up from the edge of the bank.
"Come in!" barked all the otters in chorus;
and, scrambling down the bank, the children
followed the otters into their cave. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
plenty of room, though the door was rather
small, and a big bed of prairie hay was spread
on the floor.</p>

<p>"We've been expecting you, you see," said
the mother otter, when the eight little Indians
were squatting on their hunkers and eating
berries. "The fishes told us to look out for you
about this time."</p>

<p>"Have you made friends with the fishes,
then?" asked the biggest boy.</p>

<p>"No, we're not exactly friends, only allies.
We hate the wizard more than we hate
each other, so we've joined to fight him. But
I wish it was all over, so that we could go
fishing again. Gophers are dreadfully dry
food, and they do burrow in such dusty
holes."</p>

<p>After supper the eight little Indians lay
down in a row, and all the little otters spread
themselves out into a big fur counterpane to
keep the children warm. But the big otters
sharpened their teeth as soon as it was dark,
and swam down and down and down, with
fiery eyes, till they came into the River
Saskatchewan; and then they
swam up and up and up till they
came near the wizard's pit; and
there they climbed out and hid
just under the edge of the bank.</p>

<p>Presently they felt a heavy
silent somebody tramping over
the grass from the wood, and
they knew that the grizzly bear
was coming, and one of them
slipped down to the water's edge
to tell the great grey fishes, who
were lying just inside the river.</p>

<p>"Well," said the greatest of the
fishes, "what do you want us to
do?" For he knew that the otters
must take the lead when fighting
had to be done.</p>

<p>"You must pretend to be the
wizard," said the otter, "and tell
the grizzly to come into the river
up to his waist. We can fight
much better in the water, you
know."</p>

<p>So the fish put up his head, and
called out, imitating the wizard's
voice as well as he could, "Is
that you, my son?"</p>

<p>"Of course it's me," grumbled
the bear; "and a precious hard
run I've had with this little wretch. I'd a
good mind to stop on the way and eat him
myself."</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear," said the sham
wizard. "I'll pay you well. Just bring him
in, will you? The water won't come above
your middle."</p>

<p>The grizzly grumbled something about the
water being cold, and he thought his father
might as well have come ashore; but he waded
in, all the same, and the otters dived and
swam after him. And when the water was
up to his middle the fishes swam in between
his legs and nibbled his toes, and hit him hard
on the legs with their great tails, and toppled
him right over; but still he held on to the boy
with one arm, while he clawed savagely at the
fishes with the other. Then the otters sprang
at his shoulders, and bit right through the fur
and the flesh, so that he dropped the boy in
the water; and the fishes and otters kept up
such a splashing and a jumping and a biting
that the bear could not see a foot in front of
him, and the boy dashed back to the shore
and huddled shivering under the bank.</p>

<p>"Help, help, help!" yelled the grizzly.
"They've stolen the boy! They're cutting
off my toes! They're tearing off my ears!
They're flaying me alive!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus084.jpg" width="250" height="243" alt="help" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Help, help, help!" yelled the grizzly.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then the wizard awoke, and leapt out of his
hole, and came flying to the rescue, raking the
water and the air with his long snaky arms,
and screeching horribly. But before he got to
where the grizzly was rolling over and over
in a whirlpool of mad otters and fishes and
foam, he heard the voice of his daughter, the
red wolf, who had just arrived and was calling
out (as well as she could with a little Indian's
clothes in her mouth) to ask what was the
matter.</p>

<p>"If I've lost one, I'll make sure of the
other," the wizard thought; and he seized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
boy from his daughter's mouth and plunged
down into the pit, leaving his grizzly son to
look after himself.</p>

<p>"We must save the boy!" cried the head
otter.</p>

<p>"He's not worth saving," said the fishes;
"haven't we done enough for one night?"</p>

<p>The otters did not condescend to answer, but
swam hotly after the wizard, and the fishes
followed without another word, leaving the
grizzly to hobble ashore and lick his wounds.</p>

<p>None of the otters had ever dared to descend
the wizard's pit before, and none of the fishes
had ever ventured within a hundred feet of its
mouth; but now the otters' blood was up, and
they dived like a flash, and caught up the
wizard before he got to the bottom, and
fastened on his heels, and dug their teeth into
his calves. The wizard flung himself round
and gripped an otter in each hand; but they
gnawed his wrists till their teeth met in the
sinews, and the rest of the otters swarmed
round his neck and cut his head right off.</p>

<p>"The boy is drowned, all the same," said
the head fish, who swam bravely down into
the pit when he heard the otters' scream of
victory.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said the head otter; "it's
only his badness that's drowned; the boy will
be righter than ever if you hurry ashore with
him."</p>

<p>So the fishes pushed him up to the air and
rolled him ashore; though it was rather difficult,
as he had not the sense to hold on, and
they had no arms to hold him by.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the otters had gone down to the
very bottom of the pit, and bitten through the
teacher's cords; and she kissed their wet
foreheads and left her dark prison, and the
rising sun flung her a rosy welcome as she
stepped out on to dry ground. The squinting
wolf shut her eyes and howled, and fled
into the wood with her tail between her
legs.</p>

<p>The eight little Indians were having a fine
romp with the little otters when the big otters
came back, tired and wounded, but proud with
glorious news. As soon as the story was told,
the head otter said&mdash;"Now, children, it's
time to go home, and the fishes are waiting.
No going through the woods this time!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the fishes humped up their
great grey backs, and the children took their
seats, and the procession never stopped till it
came to the little school-house, where the best
of all teachers stood smiling welcomes at the
door and two shamefaced little Indians pretended
to be very busy at their sums inside.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The procession never stopped till it came to the
school-house.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then there was a great hugging and kissing
and laughing and crying for joy, while the
little otters turned flying somersaults over the
desks and played catch on the grass outside,
and the fishes looked on through their water-window,
till the children were tired of play
and begged for lessons to begin.</p>

<h2>TEMPERANCE NOTES AND NEWS.</h2>

<p class="center">By a Leading Temperance Advocate.</p>


<h4>A MODEL TOWN.</h4>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus086.jpg" alt="I" width="110" height="102" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">"Could we but do away with
intemperance, the conditions
of living would
become so changed that
we should hardly know
ourselves," said John
Bright on a memorable
occasion. What would
the country be like without public-houses?
We can form some idea of the altered state of
affairs by taking a trip to the model town of
Bessbrook in the county of Armagh. Here we
shall find a thriving, populous community
without any public-house or place for the sale
of intoxicating liquor. It owes its origin to
the philanthropic prescience of the late John
Grubb Richardson, a wealthy member of the
Society of Friends. In the early 'sixties he
purchased an estate of some sixty thousand
acres, and there erected the factory which
is now world-famed as the Bessbrook Flax
Spinning Mills. Approaching the town from
Newry, the spinning mills form the most
prominent feature in the view. The immense
range of lofty buildings is of noble proportions,
and for massive elegance compares
very favourably with similar erections in the
Lancashire and Yorkshire factory districts.
When the mills are in full work, occupation
is afforded for about five thousand hands.
The chief feature of the model town is a
handsome square. There are several shops in
addition to the co-operative stores, and the
houses are well built, varying in size, every
family being accommodated with three to
six rooms, according to the number of its
members. There is an institute with a capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
library, a recreation room, a dispensary,
excellent schools under the supervision of
the National Board of Education, a savings
bank, and half-a-dozen places of worship,
the respective congregations supporting the
current expenses. The sale of intoxicating
liquors is entirely prohibited, and, as a
consequence, there is not only an absence of
drunkenness, but a general freedom from the
legion of evils which seem inseparable from
the liquor traffic. There is no resident police
officer, and it is only quite recently that there
has been any police perambulation of the
model town, this latter being due more to
political disturbances in the near neighbourhood
than to any outbreak of crime on the part
of the inhabitants of Bessbrook itself. The
North of Ireland thus furnishes an excellent
example of how to make the working classes
thrifty, sober, industrious, happy and prosperous.</p>

<h4>A VILLAGE EXPERIMENT.</h4>

<p>The Rev. W. E. Bolland, M.A., vicar of
Embleton, Northumberland, has, in conjunction
with some friends, launched a scheme for a
model club and hall for the village. The
plan contains some novel features, inasmuch
as it embraces a working men's club, a
public hall available for meetings, entertainments,
etc.; a café and refreshment rooms,
specially catering for cyclists and visitors;
bedrooms for summer visitors, and also a
public laundry. The catering will exclude
the provision of intoxicants, and it will be
seen from the illustration that the architect
has planned a very attractive looking house.
This village scheme will be closely watched,
and, if it should succeed, there can be no
doubt that the enterprising vicar of Embleton
will have many followers.</p>

<h4>THE BLUECOAT BOYS.</h4>

<p>In a very short time London will be deprived
of one of its most picturesque sights&mdash;namely,
the tramp of its seven hundred or more Bluecoat
boys to the Mansion House on Easter
Tuesday to pay their respects to the Lord
Mayor and Lady Mayoress, and receive a
monetary gift, and a bun and a glass of wine.
The Grecians are given a sovereign and a
shilling each; the junior Grecians a half-sovereign
and a sixpence; the monitors half-a-crown;
and the other boys a shilling each.
The removal of this famous school to the
country will possibly put an end to the function.
The glass of wine has become a diminishing
quantity in recent years; for, thanks to the
activity of a friend at court, lemonade was
introduced as an alternative a few years back,
and now the teetotal boys have no hesitation
in availing themselves of this beverage. The
preacher of the Spital sermon this year is to
be a life-long abstainer, the Bishop of Carlisle.</p>


<h4>COMING EVENTS.</h4>

<p>The programmes for the May meetings are
now nearing completion. The Church of
England Temperance Society announces as
speakers the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Bishop of Chichester, the Bishop of Thetford,
and the Rev. Dr. Ridgeway; the National
Temperance League relies upon the Archbishop
of Canterbury, Mr. T. W. Russell, M.P., Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
John Colville, M.P., the Rev. George Hanson,
B.D., and Miss Agnes Weston; while Sir George
Williams will preside for the United Kingdom
Band of Hope Union. The annual meetings
of the Scottish Temperance League will be
held in Glasgow on April 17th; the annual
meeting of the Sussex Band of Hope Union
will take place at Lewes on April 26th; a social
meeting of the Young Men's Auxiliary of the
National Temperance League will be held in
Sion College on April 21st; the Hackney and
East Middlesex Band of Hope Union will give
a reception in honour of its new President, the
Dowager Countess of Errol, on April 20th. The
usual open-air demonstrations in the London
parks, promoted by the United Temperance
Council will take place on Saturday, June
17th. The Rev. F. B. Meyer will preach the
annual sermon of the Congregational Total
Abstinence Society. The Archbishop of Canterbury
and Mrs. Temple will give a Garden
Party at Lambeth Palace on July 1st to meet
the official advocates of the temperance movement.
The Norwich Diocesan temperance anniversary
will be held at Norwich from October
17th to October 24th inclusive.</p>

<h4>TOTAL ABSTAINING BISHOPS.</h4>

<p>A few weeks ago the Lord Bishop of
Llandaff agreeably surprised the temperance
workers of Cardiff by announcing that he
had definitely decided to try total abstinence.
It may not be generally known that the Right
Rev. H. J. Foss, who has recently been consecrated
Bishop of Osaka, is an abstainer, and
has been an active temperance worker during
the whole of his twenty years' residence in
Japan. The Bishop of Islington and the Bishop
of Southampton are also total abstainers.</p>

<p class="center">THE BRADFORD TEMPERANCE HALL.</p></div>
</div>


<h4>THE FIRST TEMPERANCE HALL IN THE WORLD.</h4>

<p>The city of Bradford claims to possess the
first Temperance Hall in the world. The
foundation stone was laid on Monday,
March 13th, 1837, and the building was opened
on February 27th, 1838, by the Bishop of Ripon,
Dr. Longley (who in succession became Bishop
of Durham, Archbishop of York, and Archbishop
of Canterbury). This famous building
is still in regular use, the Bradford Temperance
Society being one of the most vigorous associations
in the country. A unique feature of
the hall is a very handsome painted window
in memory of the late John Priestman. It
is a four-light window, and contains four
female figures robed in mediæval costumes,
and representing "Religion," "Temperance,"
"Health," and "Prosperity." Above the
central light is an effective portrait of Mr.
Priestman. Mr. George Field in his interesting
"Historical Survey of the Bradford
Temperance Society," says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The hall of this, the first temperance
society in England, has been a battle-field
for many conflicts with drink, and some of
the greatest orators have made its walls
re-echo with their oratory. It has had
amongst its friends and workers some of the
best men and women of Bradford. By its
agency many a degraded sot has been rescued
and restored to respectability in society, but
while the curse of drink remains the work
will have to go on."</p>

<h3>With Illustrative Anecdotes and References.</h3>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">APRIL 16th.</span>&mdash;<strong>Jesus Teaching Humility.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;St. John xiii. 1-17.</em> <em>Golden Text&mdash;Ver. 15.</em></p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/illus089a.jpg" alt="I" width="110" height="111" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">So far have had Christ's <em>active</em>
life coupled with His
teachings. Come now to
His <em>passive</em> life just
before the close. To-day's
lesson&mdash;a sort of
active parable&mdash;teaching
His giving up Himself
for man.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>I. The Washing</strong> (1-11).
<em>The time.</em> Just before Christ's last Passover.
Supper being "at hand" (Revised Version); washing
taking place before a meal (St. Mark vii. 3).
Always known as the "Last Supper" or Passover
Feast. His "hour" for showing Himself fully as
the Saviour was now come.</p>

<p><em>The cause</em> (ver. 1). Love passing all knowledge
(Eph. iii. 19). Shown by its <em>greatness</em>&mdash;loved to the
uttermost; its <em>comprehensiveness</em>&mdash;including even
Judas; its <em>lowliness</em>&mdash;doing a servant's work.</p>

<p><em>The act.</em> Disciples began to dispute which should
be the greatest (St. Luke xxii. 24). Christ shows
by His action what His opinion is. The greatest in
His kingdom are they who serve most. Takes
towel, water, basin; washes feet of each in turn.
Who declines to accept the act of service? But
unless Peter submits to Christ, can have no part
with Him. He dreads separation from Him, therefore
is eager now to be wholly washed. Christ
tells him two things&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) He cannot understand meaning of this act
but will hereafter&mdash;will add to his faith, virtue (or
valour), and knowledge (2 Pet. i. 3).</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) He who is washed, <em>i.e.</em> bathed (Greek), in
Christ's atoning blood (Zech. xiii. 1) needs only
to "wash" or be washed from daily sin to be
kept clean and holy.</p>

<p><strong>II. The Meaning</strong> (12-17). <em>Equality</em> in Christ's
service. He is their Master, but delights to serve
them. Followers must copy His example.</p>

<p><em>Service.</em> The spirit of His example to be followed&mdash;feeding
hungry, teaching ignorant, visiting the
sick and sad (St. Matt. xxv. 35, 36).</p>

<p><em>Knowledge.</em> Life's mysteries to be cleared up
hereafter. Duties now, rewards future.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?</p>


<p class="center"><strong>Kindness to the Poor.</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The great general, Sir William Napier, once met a
little girl in a country lane sobbing over a broken bowl.
She had dropped it after taking her father's dinner, and
expected to be beaten for her carelessness. Suddenly
a gleam of hope seemed to cheer her. "You can mend
it, sir," she said, "can't you?" Sir William explained
that he could not mend it, but could give her sixpence
to buy another. It chanced, however, that he had no
money with him, so he promised to meet her at the
same time and place the next day with a sixpence.
On his return home, he found an invitation to dinner
the next day to meet someone whom he specially wished
to see. What was he to do? He could not do both;
but the child had trusted him. He must do his duty
to the poor before thinking of his own pleasure. So
he declined the invitation and helped, as he had promised,
Christ's little one.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">April 23rd.</span>&mdash;<strong>Jesus the Way, Truth, and Life.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;St. John xiv. 1-14.</em> <em>Golden Text&mdash;Ver. 6.</em></p>

<p>Discourse with disciples at Last Supper continued.
Peter, boasting of his steadfastness, been
warned of his coming fall, that very night (xiii. 38),
but comforted by thought of heaven to all who come
to God by Him for pardon.</p>

<p><strong>I. The Many Mansions.</strong> What they are? Abiding
places (Greek). This world passes away&mdash;heaven
endures. They are many in number&mdash;room for all.
Also prepared by Christ for all who believe in Him.
Christ by His death opened heaven to man, and
waits there to receive His people.</p>

<p><strong>II. The Way to Heaven</strong> (4-7). <em>Christ the Way.</em>
Came to reveal this. None else could make atonement.
God's holy Son alone could, by dying for
sin, open way to heaven for sinners. He alone
lifted up, gives eternal life (iii. 14, 15).</p>

<p><em>Christ the Truth.</em> Yet charged that night with
blasphemy, worst of all falsehoods, making Himself
God (xix. 7). Yet was the perfect truth. Exposed
hypocrisy of chief priests, hollowness of Scribes and
Pharisees (St. Luke xi. 39, 44). Taught the spirit
of the commandments in Sermon on Mount (St. Matt.
v. 21, 22, 28, 39, etc.). Acted truth in His own perfect
life. Taught God's truth to men.</p>

<p><em>Christ the Life</em>, though put to death day following.
Author of life; the world made by Him.
Gave natural life once more to three dead persons.
Gave spiritual life to Nicodemus, who became disciple;
Samaritan who accepted His teaching (iv. 42).
Raised Himself from the dead, and gives eternal
life to as many as believe.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> He that believeth in Me shall not die.</p>

<p><strong>III. The Father Revealed</strong> (8-14). Cannot be seen
by mortal eye (i. 18), but is seen in person of His
Son. Christ reveals the person of the Father full
of love and pity to those in need; full of anger
against hypocrites, liars, etc. (viii. 44). Christ also
reveals works of God, miracles of mercy. Same,
and even greater, power of working miracles
promised to His disciples after His departure. Also
answers to prayer made to the Father in His name.</p>

<p>So the revelation of the Father shows Him as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
loving Person, a Giver of power, a Hearer of
prayer. What more can Philip need?</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong></p>

<p class="center"><strong>"Is that All?"</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A wounded soldier in a hospital was visited by a
clergyman, who saw that his life was fast ebbing out.
"Young man," said he, "you are soon to die; are you
saved from sin?" "No, sir," was the reply; "what must
I do?" "'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved.'" "Say that again," said the soldier.
It was repeated. Steadily looking at the minister, the
soldier said, "Is that all?" "Yes, that is all. No
man goeth to the Father but by Him." Closing his
eyes for a few moments, the young soldier opened
them again and, raising his right hand, exclaimed,
"Lord Jesus, I surrender." Instantly his face shone
with brightness, and in a few days the new-born soul
went home to God.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">April 30th.</span>&mdash;<strong>The Comforter Promised.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;St. John xiv. 15-27.</em> <em>Golden Text&mdash;Ver. 16.</em></p>

<p>Christ continues to comfort and teach His disciples
ready for the time when He must leave them.</p>

<p><strong>I. The Comforter</strong> (15-17). See the order in the
spiritual life. First faith to believe in Him (ver. 1),
then love to cling to Him, then obedience to work
for Him. He will help them. He must leave
them, but will not forget them. Will send Another
to be with them always&mdash;the Comforter.</p>

<p><em>His person.</em> Divine in nature; equal to the
Father and Son (Acts v. 3, 4).</p>

<p><em>His name.</em> Holy Ghost, or Holy Spirit of God.</p>

<p><em>His work.</em> To aid Christ's people. How does He
do so? By helping their prayers (Rom. viii. 26).
By giving counsel, <em>e.g.</em> showing how to speak to
adversaries (St. Matt. x. 19, 20), of which Stephen
is an example (Acts vi. 10). By strengthening their
souls to do right; hence called the Comforter or
Strengthener. Also by revealing the things of God.</p>

<p><strong>11. The Result</strong> (18-27). Consolations of Christ's
people. <em>Comfort</em> by His continual presence. <em>Life</em>
present and future because of union with Him.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons.</strong> 1. Fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.</p>

<p>2. If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he
is none of His.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">May 7th.</span>&mdash;<strong>The Vine and the Branches.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;St. John xv. 1-16.</em> <em>Golden Text&mdash;Ver. 5.</em></p>

<p>This parable one of two only in this Gospel. Spoken
in court of Temple after leaving Passover Feast.</p>

<p><strong>I. The Parable</strong> (1-8). <em>The Vine</em> itself must be
good and true, planted in soil prepared for it.
Husbandman places, cares for, and watches over it.
Unfruitful branches must be cut off, fruitful ones
purged&mdash;to produce more fruit&mdash;dead ones burned.
Much fruit redounds to glory of husbandman.</p>

<p><em>The meaning.</em> Christ Himself is the true ideal
Vine, doing always such things as please God. The
husbandman is God, who placed Him in the world
(iii. 16) and watched over Him (St. Matt. iii. 17).
The branches are believers joined to Him by living
faith. Fruit&mdash;the graces of a Christian life.</p>

<p>What are results of union with Christ the Vine?
<em>Life</em> to the soul from life of Christ. <em>Fruit</em> outward
result of inward life. <em>Answers</em> to prayer. Christ
and His people alike heard. <em>Glory</em> to God the Father.</p>

<p><strong>II. Results of Union</strong> (9-16). Metaphor dropped.
Christ urges disciples to continue in His love.
Then they will have <em>full joy</em>; <em>love</em> to all arising
from love to Him; <em>friendship</em> of Christ as evidenced
by His death for them; <em>knowledge</em> because of
revelation of Father. <em>Permanence</em> of results.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> Are we truly joined to Christ? What
fruit is seen in our lives?</p>


<p class="center"><strong>Joy through Faith.</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bunyan, in "The Pilgrim's Progress," pictures Christiana
as saying to Mercy, "What was the matter that you
did laugh in your sleep last night?" And Mercy said,
"But are you sure I laughed?" When she told her
dream, Christiana said, "Laugh, ay, well you might to
see yourself so well." She laughed because she dreamed
that she had been welcomed into glory. To faith this
is no dream. Saved by grace, adopted by the Father,
united to the Son, taught by the Spirit, we have joy
in the soul now and a good hope of glory hereafter.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">May 14th.</span>&mdash;<strong>Christ Betrayed and Arrested.</strong></p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;St. John xviii. 1-14.</em> <em>Golden Text&mdash;Is. liii. 3.</em></p>

<p>Christ's hour now come&mdash;has finished teachings&mdash;must
go forth to die. Path of sorrow to be trod&mdash;He
does not shrink.</p>

<p><strong>I. Christ Betrayed</strong> (1-11). <em>The place.</em> The garden
or olive orchard of Gethsemane. Note that Christ
went forth of His own will, knowing all before Him.
Also He went not for concealment, but for prayer.</p>

<p><em>The band.</em> Judas, His disciple, their leader. A
band of Roman soldiers to prevent a tumult, and
officers of the Temple police supplied by chief priests.
Also chief priests and elders, and a mixed rabble
(St. Luke xxii. 52). All had common hatred of
Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p><em>The incidents.</em> Jesus comes forth with His three
disciples, Peter, James, John. He asks, "Whom
seek ye?" Soldiers fall back in surprise. He asks
again&mdash;they answer. He asks that disciples may go
their way. Request granted; He lost none. St.
Peter with sword wounds Malchus. Christ heals
his ear (St. Luke xxii. 51) and rebukes Peter.
Note the forbearance and majesty of Christ; the
loving impetuosity of St. Peter; the malice of
Judas and the gratified hatred of chief priests.</p>

<p><strong>II. Christ a Prisoner</strong> (12-14). The soldiers close
in. Prisoner bound because of attempt to rescue.
The captain secures Christ, leads Him to Annas,
chief of priests and president of Jewish Sanhedrim.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons.</strong> <em>From Judas.</em> Beware of covetousness.</p>

<p><em>From St. Peter.</em> The weapons of our warfare
are not carnal.</p>

<p><em>From Christ.</em> He loved me and gave Himself
for me. What have I given Him?</p>


<p class="center"><strong>Christ Loved Best.</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A martyr was going to be burned for Christ's sake.
His friends brought out his wife and young children, and
made them kneel in a long row and ask their father, for
their sakes, to deny the faith and live. But as he kissed
them one by one he said, "I would do anything for
your sakes that I might live with you, but since it is for
Christ my Lord's sake, I must tear myself away even
from you." So he went to the stake.</p></blockquote>

<h2>SHORT ARROWS</h2>

<h3>NOTES OF CHRISTIAN LIFE AND WORK.</h3>


<h4>A Remarkable Church Doorway.</h4>

<p>Clonfert Cathedral, in County Galway,
can boast a very remarkable and ancient
doorway, which is regarded as one of the
finest specimens of Hiberno-Romanesque
work now in existence. The shafts and piers
present an astonishing variety of decoration;
every inch of its surface has been worked
by the sculptor's tool. Above the rounded archway
rises a triangular space filled with many
carvings, while the archway itself consists of
several decorated semicircles, one within the other.
Norman and Romanesque porches may be found of
grander proportions; but Brash, in his "Ecclesiastical
Architecture of Ireland," declares that "in
point of design and execution" he had not seen this
beautiful porch "excelled by any similar features in
these islands," and specially mentions its beauty
of design and fertility of invention. The Cathedral
itself has had a long and interesting history.
It was founded by St. Brendan in the year 558,
and suffered greatly from the Danes. It was burnt
six times between 744 and 1179, and was plundered
thrice between 949 and 1065. In 1541 it was almost
destroyed. Repaired by Bishop Wolley in 1664, it
was subsequently altered and improved to some
extent, but no general work of restoration was
done, and consequently it is in great need of repair.
To this work Canon McLarney, the present rector
of Clonfert, has set his hand. Though small, the
building is very beautiful, and is now used as the
parish church, the parish of Clonfert being very
large and measuring twenty-seven Irish miles in
circumference. The work of restoration is proceeding
in sections as funds are provided by the
public. The chancel has already been restored,
and Canon McLarney hopes to collect a thousand
pounds to complete the work on the nave. One
need not leave the British Isles to see very ancient
and interesting structures, and a writer lately said
it would be worth a pilgrimage to Connaught to
see Clonfert doorway alone.</p>

</div>


<h4>The Westminster Choir Boys.</h4>

<p>Nowhere in England do the trained voices of a
choir seem to harmonise more perfectly with the
surroundings than in Westminster Abbey. Architecture,
as an old German philosopher once described
it, is but "frozen music" after all. The
noble anthems that rise soaring upwards amongst
the fluted columns and giant arches, the hymns of
praise that roll through the long aisles seem, as we
listen to the sacred music, not only to give thanks
to Him who "made the earth so bright," but to
Him who gave England such men as lie in the
sculptured tombs around us. Not far from the
Abbey&mdash;some three minutes' walk, in fact, through
Dean's Yard&mdash;stands a tall, red-brick building. It
is the choir school, where live the twenty-four
boys of the choir under the headmastership of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
Arthur Hore. To gain admission, a boy must be at
least eight years of age, possessing a good voice and
the knowledge of the rudiments of music; he will
also be expected to read and write fairly. His
examination on these points will be conducted by
the master of the choristers, Sir J. Frederick Bridge,
or someone appointed by him. If he passes satisfactorily,
he will become a probationer, paying £10
a year towards his expenses; at the end of three
years, however, he will become a recognised member
of the Abbey choir, and no further charge will be
made. The internal arrangements of the choir
house are excellent. On the ground floor are the
big class-room and the dining-room. To see the
youngsters attacking a joint of roast beef is a conclusive
proof that the boy who sings like a young
seraph is, nevertheless, far from being the wishy-washy
individual that he is often represented to be
in some poems and sentimental novels. On the
second floor is another big class-room containing the
school library. Walter Scott is there, and rows of
well-thumbed volumes of Henty. Many years ago
Princess Alice gave a present of books to the school.
For some time they were kept ceremoniously shut
up in a glass case. The present headmaster, however,
recognising that the kind donor would have
strongly objected to such a foolish use being made
of the volumes, placed them in the library for
general use. On the third floor are the plain, clean
dormitories with their rows of little iron beds and
the regulation striped rugs over all.</p>

<h4>A Chinese Y.M.C.A.</h4>

<p>Amid the discouragements which the recent
revolution in Pekin has occasioned to those concerned
in China's welfare&mdash;for the movement in
question is manifestly anti-reform, anti-foreign,
and consequently anti-Christian&mdash;there are many
signs that such opposition cannot radically hinder
this country's enlightenment. Such a sign is the
progress of the Y.M.C.A. movement among Chinese
youths, which is assuming considerable importance,
especially in connection with mission schools. It was
found desirable to invite from America an experienced
worker in this department; and though it
will be some time before this gentleman can speak
Chinese, there is no difficulty in the matter of interpreters,
native or foreign. Yesterday in our large
Shanghai mission church&mdash;says a correspondent&mdash;there
were gathered 200 Chinese boy-scholars
from various mission stations in and near Shanghai,
all of whom were either members of the local
Y.M.C.A. or willing to join it. Earnest addresses
were given and prayers offered, both in English
and Chinese, the English addresses being admirably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
translated by a Christian Chinaman; while the
bright hymn-singing of these strong young voices
was a delightful sound. At the close of the morning
meeting papers were distributed to the boys
containing questions to be answered in writing,
and a form, of Christian engagement to be signed.
At the afternoon service many of these were
returned most satisfactorily and intelligently
filled in. Such assemblies have recently been
held with much interest and zeal, and apparently
solid results, at Nanking and other centres of
missionary work.</p>


<h4>The "Metal Man."</h4>

<p>At Tramore, near Waterford, a place where
the Atlantic breakers dash with sublime fury
against the rocks, there are on one of the headlands
three towers, and on the middle one stands
what is called "The Metal Man." This is a figure
made of metal, and painted to resemble a sailor.
With his finger he points to some very dangerous
rocks that are to be shunned. There are rocks
in life's troublesome sea that are ready to shipwreck
the bodies and souls of the young. These
we should point out to them with as much diligence
as does the metal man when God has saved us
from being shipwrecked upon them.</p>

<h4>A Saint's Rest.</h4>

<p>Richard Baxter was all his long life physically
weak, and for fourteen years had scarcely a
waking hour free from pain. He felt himself continually
"at the door of eternity." At the close
of his life he said, "Weakness and pain helped
me to study how to die; I am going now to
see that for which I have lived and studied."
His death was a fitting end to a life of pain and
patience&mdash;a fulfilment of his own words: "After
the rough and tempestuous day we shall at last
have the quiet, silent night&mdash;light and rest together;
the quietness of the night without its
gloom."</p>


<h4>The Quiver Pictures.</h4>

<p>The six beautiful plates which the readers of
<span class="smcap">The Quiver</span> have the opportunity of acquiring,
and the last coupon for which is contained in
this number, are representative examples of the
work of some of the most notable exponents of
sacred art among modern British painters. The
names of Leighton and Millais are now familiar
in every household, and great interest attaches to
the works from their hands included in this series
of pictures. "The Star of Bethlehem," by Lord
Leighton, was painted in 1862, when the artist
was thirty-two years of age, and four years before
his election as Associate of the Royal Academy.
The main figure represents one of the magi on the
terrace of his house, gazing at the miraculous light
which led him and his fellows to search out Him,
"who was born King of the Jews." "Christ in the
House of His Parents" is one of the most wonderful
pictures painted by Sir John Millais. It was
exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1850, when the
artist was but twenty years of age, and, as related
in the article on "Pictorial Sermons" in our last
number, aroused a storm of discussion among the
critics. The work is a veritable parable in paint,
and, as its allegories are all fully explained in the
article referred to, we need not repeat them here.
The picture has great interest, apart from this, as
being one of the best specimens of the work of the
artist's Pre-Raphaelite period. "Christ Washing
Peter's Feet," by Ford Madox Brown, which was
presented to the nation by a body of subscribers;
and now hangs in the Tate Gallery at Millbank, is
a typical painting, and one of the most beautiful examples
of this artist's work. Exquisite in colour, it
is a perfect specimen of what a picture dealing with
a sacred subject should be. Full of reverence and
piety, it yet illustrates the subject fully; the rugged
figure of the apostle, expressing withal the penitence
produced by the rebuking words, "If I wash
thee not, thou hast no part with Me," contrasts
strongly with the humility of the Master kneeling
to His self-imposed task. "The Remorse of Judas,"
by the late Edward Armitage, R.A., is another
picture to be seen at Millbank, and is, perhaps, one
of the strongest works produced by this artist.
The terror of remorse is expressed in every line
of the face of the betrayer, while the cold indifference
of the priests, now that their work is
accomplished, is admirably portrayed. "The
Raising of the Widow's Son of Nain," by W. C.
T. Dobson, R.A., was shown at the Academy in
1868, and fully explains itself. The joy of the
mother and the surprise of the beholders of the
miracle are well rendered; but the main interest
of the picture, of course, centres in the boy. His
gaze is fixed upon Him whose voice has recalled
him from the "valley of the shadow." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
last picture of the series, by W. Dyce, R.A., was
recently added to the national collection, and
was removed from Trafalgar Square to Millbank
when the new gallery was completed. It represents
the Apostle John taking Mary to his own
home after the death of their Lord. Mary carries
on her arm the crown of thorns, and in the background
may be seen Nicodemus and Joseph of
Arimathea, who are just leaving the garden
which contains the sepulchre. Mary Magdalene
and the "other Mary" are seen seated at the
mouth of the grave. The picture was painted
in 1860.</p>


<h4>Public Charity.</h4>

<p>According to a recent calculation, the amount
given during the previous year by Churchmen
towards Christian work of all kinds, such as
Church Building, Home Missions, Foreign Missions,
Education, etc., was over £5,750,000. The various
Presbyterian Churches contributed during the
same time for similar work a sum of £1,600,000,
and the Wesleyans gave over £500,000; the Calvinistic
Methodists about £228,500; the Baptists over
£200,000; and the Primitive Methodists over
£100,000. Of the Congregationalists and the
"Friends" no such statistics are available, and it
is estimated that other branches of the Christian
Church in England gave an aggregate of not less
than £150,000 towards the same work. Generally
speaking, all the different bodies contribute in a
fairly equal proportion, directly or indirectly, to
the different kinds of Christian work&mdash;at any rate,
sufficiently so for the comparison we wish to make
here. So, taking the
Church of England's
returns as our standard,
we find that
these proportions are
nearly as follows, 1 being our unit:&mdash;Church
Building and Repairs, 35; Home Missions, 7;
Foreign Missions, 10; Educational Work of all
kinds, 20; various Charitable Works of other
kinds, 6.</p>

<h4>A New Quiver Heroine.</h4>

<p>The latest recipient of the Bronze Medal of
<span class="smcap">The Quiver</span> Heroes Fund is Annie Healand, a
servant in the employ of Mr. Frederick Latham,
of Sledmere. On the afternoon of January 28th last,
two little boys and a girl were suddenly immersed
beneath the ice whilst sliding on a pond. On hearing
of this, Annie Healand, who is herself but
fifteen years of age, immediately rushed to the
rescue, and, plunging in, succeeded in bringing the
little girl to the bank. She then endeavoured to
find the two boys, who were still under the ice,
but was at last reluctantly compelled to give up
the search, through being overcome by the intense
cold. The bodies of the lads were afterwards
found, and the coroner congratulated the brave
girl for the very plucky manner in which she had
rescued one of the party and attempted to save
the others.</p>

<h2>ROLL OF HONOUR FOR SUNDAY-SCHOOL
WORKERS.</h2>

<p>The <strong>Special Silver Medal</strong> and <strong>Presentation Bible</strong>
offered for the longest known Sunday-school service
in the county of <strong>Devonshire</strong> (for which applications
were invited up to February 28th, 1899)
have been gained by</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Louisa Jane Large</span>,<br />
Cross Street, Northam, Bideford,
</p>

<p>who has distinguished herself by <strong>sixty-two</strong> complete
years' service in Northam Church Sunday School.</p>

<p>As already announced, the next territorial county
for which claims are invited for the Silver Medal is</p>

<h4>
KENT,
</h4>

<p>and applications, on the special form, must be
received on or before March 30th, 1899. We
may add that <strong>Cheshire</strong> is the following county
selected, the date-limit for claims in that case
being April 30th, 1899. This county, in its turn,
will be followed by the territorial county of
<strong>Somersetshire</strong>, for which the date will be one
month later&mdash;viz. May 31st, 1899.</p>


<p class="center">AN INTERESTING LETTER.</p>

<p>The following letter, received from the Devonshire
Silver Medallist, of whom particulars are
given above, will doubtless be interesting to all our
readers, and especially to Sunday school workers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In sending the enclosed certificates I should
like to add that I began my career as a Sunday
school teacher at the age of ten, with a class of
four little girls, and proud enough I was. That
was some time in the year 1836. From that date to
the present (1899), I have been teaching continuously
in the same school, except when occasional illness
or absence from home for a few Sundays made a
break. I am now teaching the grandchildren of
former scholars. Many changes have I seen; such
a difference in the teaching and general management
of Sunday schools since 1836! Only two or
three individuals are now living who were with
us when I began my work."</p></blockquote>
